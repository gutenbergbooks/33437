<h2>Foreword</h2>


<p><img src="images/deco2.png" width="21" height="20" alt="decorative" title="decorative" />The present day development of the "talking wire" has
annihilated both time and space, and has enabled men
thousands of miles apart to get into almost instant
communication. The user of the telephone and the telegraph
forgets the tremendousness of the feat in the simplicity of its
accomplishment; but the man who has made the feat possible
knows that its very simplicity is due to the complexity of the
principles and appliances involved; and he realizes his need of
a practical, working understanding of each principle and its
application. The Cyclopedia of Telephony and Telegraphy presents
a comprehensive and authoritative treatment of the whole
art of the electrical transmission of intelligence.</p>

<p><img src="images/deco2.png" width="21" height="20" alt="decorative" title="decorative" />The communication engineer&mdash;if so he may be called&mdash;requires
a knowledge both of the mechanism of his instruments and of
the vagaries of the current that makes them talk. He requires as
well a knowledge of plants and buildings, of office equipment,
of poles and wires and conduits, of office system and time-saving
methods, for the transmission of intelligence is a business as
well as an art. And to each of these subjects, and to all others
pertinent, the Cyclopedia gives proper space and treatment.</p>

<p><img src="images/deco2.png" width="21" height="20" alt="decorative" title="decorative" />The sections on Telephony cover the installation, maintenance,
and operation of all standard types of telephone systems;
they present without prejudice the respective merits of manual
and automatic exchanges; and they give special attention to
the prevention and handling of operating "troubles." The
sections on Telegraphy cover both commercial service and train
dispatching. Practical methods of wireless communication&mdash;both
by telephone and by telegraph&mdash;are thoroughly treated.</p>

<p><img src="images/deco2.png" width="21" height="20" alt="decorative" title="decorative" />The drawings, diagrams, and photographs incorporated into
the Cyclopedia have been prepared especially for this work;
and their instructive value is as great as that of the text itself.
They have been used to illustrate and illuminate the text, and
not as a medium around which to build the text. Both drawings
and diagrams have been simplified so far as is compatible
with their correctness, with the result that they tell their own
story and always in the same language.</p>

<p><img src="images/deco2.png" width="21" height="20" alt="decorative" title="decorative" />The Cyclopedia is a compilation of many of the most valuable
Instruction Papers of the American School of Correspondence,
and the method adopted in its preparation is that which this
School has developed and employed so successfully for many
years. This method is not an experiment, but has stood the
severest of all tests&mdash;that of practical use&mdash;which has demonstrated
it to be the best yet devised for the education of the
busy, practical man.</p>

<p><img src="images/deco2.png" width="21" height="20" alt="decorative" title="decorative" />In conclusion, grateful acknowledgment is due to the staff
of authors and collaborators, without whose hearty co-operation
this work would have been impossible.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII"></a>CHAPTER XXII<br />

<span style="font-size:80%;">THE SIMPLE COMMON-BATTERY SWITCHBOARD</span></h2>


<p><b>Advantages of Common-Battery Operation.</b> The advantages of
the common-battery system of operation, alluded to in Chapter XIII,
may be briefly summarized here. The main gain in the common-battery
system of supply is the simplification of the subscribers'
instruments, doing away with the local batteries and the magneto
generators, and the concentration of all these many sources of current
into one single source at the central office. A considerable
saving is thus effected from the standpoint of maintenance, since
the simpler common-battery instrument is not so likely to get out
of order and, therefore, does not have to be visited so often for repairs,
and the absence of local batteries, of course, makes the renewal of
the battery parts by members of the maintenance department,
unnecessary. Another decided advantage in the common-battery
system is the fact that the centralized battery stands ready always
to send current over the line when the subscriber completes the
circuit of the line at his station by removing his receiver from its
hook. The common-battery system, therefore, lends itself naturally
to the purposes of automatic signaling, since it is only necessary to
place at the central office a device in the circuit of each line that will
be responsive to the current which flows from the central battery
when the subscriber removes his receiver from its hook. It is thus
that the subscriber is enabled automatically to signal the central
office when he desires a connection; and as will be shown, it is by
the same sort of means, associated with the cord circuits used in connecting
his line with some other line, that the operator is automatically
notified when a disconnection is desired, the cessation of current
through the subscriber's line when he hangs up his receiver being
made to actuate certain responsive devices which are associated with
the cord at that time connected with his line, and which convey
the proper disconnect signal to the operator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Page 12]</a></span></p><p>Concentration of sources of energy into a single large unit, the
simplification of the subscriber's station equipment, and the ready
adaptability to automatic signaling from the subscriber to the central
office are, therefore, the reasons for the existence of the common-battery
system.</p>

<p><b>Common Battery vs. Magneto.</b> It must not be supposed, however,
that the common-battery system always has advantages over
the magneto system, and that it is superior to the magneto or local-battery
system for all purposes. It is the outward attractiveness
of the common-battery system and the arguments in its favor, so
readily made by over-zealous salesmen, that has led, in many
cases, to the adoption of this system when the magneto system
would better have served the purpose of utility and economy.</p>

<p>To say the least, the telephone transmission to be had from
common-battery systems is no better than that to be had from local-battery
systems, and as a rule, assuming equality in other respects,
it is not as good. It is perhaps true, however, that under average
conditions common-battery transmission is somewhat better, because
whereas the local batteries at the subscribers' stations in
the local-battery system are not likely to be in uniformly first-class
condition, the battery in a common-battery system will be kept up
to its full voltage except under the grossest neglect.</p>

<p>The places in which the magneto, or local-battery, system is to
be preferred to the common-battery system, in the opinion of the
writers, are to be found in the small rural communities where the
lines have a rather great average length; where a good many subscribers
are likely to be found on some of the lines; where the sources
of electrical power available for charging storage batteries are likely
either not to exist, or to be of a very uncertain nature; and where it
is not commercially feasible to employ a high-grade class of attendants,
or, in fact, any attendant at all other than the operator at the
central office.</p>

<p>In large or medium-sized exchanges it is always possible to procure
suitable current for charging the storage batteries required in
common-battery systems, and it is frequently economical, on account
of the considerable quantity of energy that is thus used, to
establish a generating plant in connection with the central office for
developing the necessary electrical energy. In very small rural
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Page 13]</a></span>places there are frequently no available sources of electrical energy,
and the expense of establishing a power plant for the purpose cannot
be justified. But even if there is an electric light or railway
system in the small town, so that the problem of available current
supply does not exist, the establishment of a common-battery system
with its storage battery and the necessary charging machinery requires
the daily attendance at the central office of some one to watch and
care for this battery, and this, on account of the small gross revenue
that may be derived from a small telephone system, often involves
a serious financial burden.</p>

<p>There is no royal road to a proper decision in the matter, and no
sharp line of demarcation may be drawn between the places where
common-battery systems are superior to magneto and <i>vice versâ</i>. It
may be said, however, that in the building of all new telephone
plants having over about 500 local subscribers, the common-battery
system is undoubtedly superior to the magneto. If the plant is an
old one, however, and is to be re-equipped, the continuance of magneto
apparatus might be justified for considerably larger exchanges
than those having 500 subscribers.</p>

<p>Telephone operating companies who have changed over the
equipment of old plants from magneto to common battery have
sometimes been led into rather serious difficulty, owing to the fact
that their lines, while serving tolerably well for magneto work, were
found inadequate to meet the more exacting demands of common-battery
work. Again in an old plant the change from magneto to
common-battery equipment involves not only the change of switchboards,
but also the change of subscribers' instruments that are
otherwise good, and this consideration alone often, in our opinion,
justifies the replacing of an old magneto board with a new magneto
board, even if the exchange is of such size as to demand a small
multiple board.</p>

<p>Where the plant to be established is of such size as to leave doubt
as to whether a magneto or a common-battery switchboard should
be employed, the questions of availability of the proper kind of power
for charging the batteries, the proper kind of help for maintaining
the batteries and the more elaborate central-office equipment, the
demands and previous education of the public to be served, all are
factors which must be considered in reaching the decision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Page 14]</a></span></p><p>It is not proper to say that anything like all exchanges having
fewer than 500 local lines, should be equipped with magneto service.
Where all the lines are short, where suitable power is available, and
where a good grade of attendants is available&mdash;as, for instance, in
the case of private telephone exchanges that serve some business
establishment or other institution located in one building or a group
of buildings&mdash;the common-battery system is to be recommended and
is largely used, even though it may have but a dozen or so subscribers'
lines. It is for such uses, and for use in those regular public-service
exchange systems where the conditions are such as to warrant
the common-battery system, and yet where the number of lines
and the traffic are small enough to be handled by such a small group
of operators that any one of them may reach over the entire face of
the board, that the simple non-multiple common-battery system
finds its proper field of usefulness.</p>

<p><b>Line Signals.</b> The principles and means by which the subscriber
is enabled to call the central-office operator in a common-battery
system have been referred to briefly in Chapter III. We will
review these at this point and also consider briefly the way in which
the line signals are associated with the connective devices in the
subscribers' lines.</p>

<p><i>Direct-Line Lamp.</i> The simplest possible way is to put the
line signal directly in the circuit of the line in series with the central-office
battery, and so to arrange the jack of the corresponding line
that the circuit through the line signal will be open when the operator
inserts a plug into that jack. This arrangement is shown in
Fig. 307 where the subscriber's station at the left is indicated in the
simplest of its forms. It is well to repeat here that in all common-battery
manual systems, the subscriber's station equipment, regardless
of the arrangement or type of its talking and signaling apparatus,
must have these features: First, that the line shall be normally
open to direct currents at the subscriber's station; second,
that the line shall be closed to direct currents when the subscriber
removes his receiver from its hook in making or in answering a call;
third, that the line normally, although open to direct currents, shall
afford a proper path for alternating or varying currents through the
signal receiving device at the sub-station. The subscriber's station
arrangement shown in Fig. 307, and those immediately following,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Page 15]</a></span>is the simplest arrangement that possesses these three necessary
features for common-battery service.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig307_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 307. Direct-Line Lamp</b><br />
<a href="images/fig307.png">View full size illustration.</a>
</div>

<p>Considering the arrangement at the central office, Fig. 307,
the two limbs of the line are permanently connected to the tip and
sleeve contacts of the jack. These two main contacts of the jack
normally engage two anvils so connected that the tip of the jack is
ordinarily connected through its anvil to ground, while the sleeve
of the jack is normally connected through its anvil to a circuit
leading through the line signal&mdash;in this case a lamp&mdash;and the
common battery, and thence to ground. The operation is obvious.
Normally no current may flow from the common battery through
the signal because the line is open at the subscriber's station. The
removal of the subscriber's receiver from its hook closes the circuit
of the line and allows the current to flow through the lamp, causing
it to glow. When the operator inserts the plug into the jack, in response
to the call, the circuit through the lamp is cut off at the jack
and the lamp goes out.</p>

<p>This arrangement, termed the direct-line lamp arrangement,
is largely used in small common-battery telephone systems where the
lines are very short, such as those found in factories or other places
where the confines of the exchange are those of a building or a
group of neighboring buildings. Many of the so-called private-branch
exchanges, which will be considered more in detail in a later
chapter, employ this direct-line lamp arrangement.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig308_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 308. Direct-Line Lamp with Ballast</b><br />
<a href="images/fig308.png">View full size illustration.</a>
</div>

<p><i>Direct-Line Lamp with Ballast.</i> Obviously, however, this
direct-line lamp arrangement is not a good one where the lines vary
widely in length and resistance. An incandescent lamp, as is well
known, must not be subjected to too great a variation in current. If
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Page 16]</a></span>the current that is just right in amount to bring it to its intended
degree of illumination is increased by a comparatively small amount,
the life of the lamp will be greatly shortened, and too great an increase
will result in the lamp's burning out immediately. On the
other hand, a current that is too small will not result in the proper
illumination of the lamp, and a current of one-half the proper normal
value will just suffice to bring the lamp to a dull red glow. With
lines that are not approximately uniform in length and resistance the
shorter lines would afford too great a flow of current to the lamps and
the longer lines too little, and there is always the danger present, unless
means are taken to prevent it, that if a line becomes short-circuited
or grounded near the central office, the lamp will be subjected to
practically the full battery potential and, therefore, to such a current
as will burn it out. One of the very ingenious and, we believe, promising
methods that has been proposed to overcome this difficulty is
that of the iron-wire ballast, alluded to in Chapter III. This, it
will be remembered, consists of an iron-wire resistance enclosed in a
vacuum chamber and so proportioned with respect to the flow of
current that it will be subjected to a considerable heating effect by
the amount of current that is proper to illuminate the lamp. As has
already been pointed out, carbon has a negative temperature coefficient,
that is, its resistance decreases when heated. Iron, on the
other hand, has a positive temperature coefficient, its resistance increasing
when heated. When such an iron-wire ballast is put in
series with the incandescent lamp forming the line signal, as shown
in Fig. 308, it is seen that the resistance of the carbon in the lamp
filament and of the iron in the ballast will act in opposite ways when
the current increases or decreases. An increase of current will tend
to heat up the iron wire of the ballast and, therefore, increase its resistance,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Page 17]</a></span>and the ballast is so proportioned that it will hold the current
that may flow through the lamp within the proper maximum and
minimum limits, regardless of the resistance of the line in which the
lamp is used. This arrangement has not gone into wide use up to
the present time.</p>

<p><i>Line Lamp with Relay.</i> By far the most common method of
associating the line lamp with the line is to employ a relay, of
which the actuating coil is in the line circuit, this relay serving to
control a local circuit containing the battery and the lamp. This
arrangement and the way in which these parts are associated with
the jack are clearly indicated in Fig. 309. Here the relay may receive
any amount of current, from the smallest which will cause it
to pull up its armature, to the largest which will not injure its winding
by overheat. Relays may be made which will attract their armatures
at a certain minimum current and which will not burn out
when energized by currents about ten times as large, and it is thus
seen that a very large range of current through the relay winding
is permissible, and that, therefore, a very great latitude as to line
resistance is secured. On the other hand, it is obvious that the lamp
circuit, being entirely local, is of uniform resistance, the lamp always
being subjected, in the arrangement shown, to practically the full
battery potential, the lamp being selected to operate on that potential.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

</div>

<p><i>Pilot Signals.</i> In the circuits of Figs. 307, 308, and 309, but a
single line and its associated apparatus is shown, and it may not be
altogether clear to the uninitiated how it is that the battery shown in
those figures may serve, without interference of any function, a larger
number of lines than one. It is to be remembered that this battery
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Page 18]</a></span>is the one which serves not only to operate the line signals, but also
to supply talking current to the subscribers and to supply current
for the operation of the cord-circuit signals after the cord circuits are
connected with the lines.</p>

<p>In Fig. 310 this matter is made clear with respect to the association
of this common battery with the lines for operating the line
signals, and also another important feature of common-battery work is
brought out, viz, the pilot lamp and its association with a group of
line lamps. Three subscribers' lines only are shown, but this serves
clearly to illustrate the association of any larger number of lines
with the common battery. Ignoring at first the pilot relay and the
pilot lamp, it will be seen that each of the tip-spring anvils of the
jacks is connected to a common wire <i>1</i> which is grounded. Each
of the sleeve-contact anvils is connected through the coil of the line
relay to another common wire <i>2</i>, which connects with the live side
of the common battery. Obviously, therefore, this arrangement
corresponds with that of Fig. 309, since the battery may furnish current
to energize any one of the line relays upon the closure of the
circuit of the corresponding line. Each of the relay armatures in
Fig. 310 is connected to ground.</p>

<p>Here we wish to bring out an important thing about telephone
circuit diagrams which is sometimes confusing to the beginner, but
which really, when understood, tends to prevent confusion. The
showing of a separate ground for each of the line-relay armatures
does not mean that literally each one of these armatures is connected
by a separate wire to earth, and it is to be understood that the three
separate grounds shown in connection with these relay armatures is
meant to indicate just such a set of affairs as is shown in connection
with the tip-spring anvils of the jacks, all of which are connected to
a common wire which, in turn, is grounded. Obviously, the result
is the same, but in the case of this particular diagram it is seen that
a great deal of crossing of lines is prevented by showing a separate
ground at each one of the relay armatures. The same practice is
followed in connection with the common battery. Sometimes it is
very inconvenient in a complicated diagram to run all of the wires
that are supposed to connect with one terminal of the battery across
the diagram to represent this connection. It is permissible, therefore,
and in fact desirable, that separate battery symbols be shown
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Page 19]</a></span>wherever by so doing the diagram will be simplified, the understanding
being, in the absence of other information or of other indications,
that the same battery is referred to, just as the same ground is referred
to in connection with the relay armatures in the figure under
discussion.</p>

<p>Each line lamp in Fig. 310 is shown connected on one hand to
its corresponding line relay contact and on the other hand to a common
wire which leads through the winding of the pilot relay to the
live side of the battery. It is
obvious here that whenever any
one of the line relays attracts its
armature the local circuit containing
the corresponding lamp
and the common battery will be
closed and the lamp illuminated.</p>

<p>Whenever any line relay operates,
the current, which is supplied
to its lamp, must come
through the pilot-relay winding,
and if a number of line relays are
energized, then the current flow
of the corresponding lamps must
flow through this relay winding.
Therefore, this relay winding
must be of low resistance, so that
the drop through its winding may
not be sufficient to interfere with
the proper burning of the lamps,
even though a large number of
lamps be fed simultaneously
through it. The pilot relay must
be so sensitive that the current, even through one lamp, will cause
it to attract its armature. When it does attract its armature it causes
illumination of the pilot lamp in the same way that the line relays
cause the illumination of the line lamps.</p>

<p>The pilot lamp, which is commonly associated with a group of line
lamps that are placed on any one operator's position of the switchboard,
is located in a conspicuous place in the switchboard cabinet and is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Page 20]</a></span>provided with a larger lens so as to make a more striking signal. As
a result, whenever any line lamp on a given position lights, the pilot
lamp does also and serves to attract the attention, even of those located
in distant portions of the
room, to the fact that a call exists
on that position of the board, the
line lamp itself, which is simultaneously
lighted, pointing out
the particular line on which the
call exists.</p>

<p>Pilot lamps, in effect, perform
similar service to the night alarm
in magneto boards, but, of course, they are silent and do not attract
attention unless within the range of vision of the operator. They
are used not only in connection with line lamps, but also in connection
with the cord-circuit lamps
or signals, as will be pointed out.</p>

<p><b>Cord Circuit.</b> <i>Battery Supply.</i>
Were it not for the necessity of
providing for cord-circuit signals
in common-battery switchboards,
the common-battery cord circuit
would be scarcely more complex
than that for magneto working.
Stripped of all details, such as signals, ringing and listening keys,
and operator's equipment, cord circuits of three different types are
shown in Figs. 311, 312, and 313. These merely illustrate the way
in which the battery is associated
with the cord circuits and through
them with the line circuits for supplying
current for talking purposes
to the subscribers. It is thought
that this matter will be clear in
view of the discussion of the methods
by which current is supplied
to the subscribers' transmitters in
common-battery systems as discussed in Chapter XIII. While
the arrangements in this respect of Figs. 311, 312, and 313 illustrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Page 21]</a></span>only three of the methods, these three are the ones that have been
most widely and successfully used.</p>

<p><i>Supervisory Signals.</i> The signals that are associated with the
cord circuits are termed supervisory signals because of the fact that
by their means the operator is enabled to supervise the condition of
the lines during times when they are connected for conversation.
The operation of these supervisory signals may be best understood
by considering the complete circuits of a simple switchboard and
must be studied in conjunction with the circuits of the lines as well as
those of the cords.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig314_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 314. Simple Common-Battery Switchboard</b><br />
<a href="images/fig314.png">View full size illustration.</a>
</div>

<p><i>Complete Circuit.</i> Such complete circuits are shown in Fig. 314.
The particular arrangement indicated is that employed by the Kellogg
Company, and except for minor details may be considered as
typical of other makes also. Two subscribers' lines are shown extending
from Station A and Station B, respectively, to the central
office. The line wires are shown terminating in jacks in the same
manner as indicated in Figs. 307, 308, and 309, and their circuits
are normally continued from these jacks to the ground on one side
and to the line relay and battery on the other. The jack in this
case has three contacts adapted to register with three corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Page 22]</a></span>contacts in each of the plugs. The thimble of the jack in this case
forms no part of the talking circuit and is distinct from the two jack
springs which form the line terminals. It and the auxiliary contact
<i>1</i> in each of the plugs with which it registers, are solely for the purpose
of co-operating in the control of the supervisory signals.</p>

<p>The tip and sleeve strands of the cord are continuous from one
plug to the other except for the condensers. The two batteries indicated
in connection with the cord circuit are separate batteries,
a characteristic of the Kellogg system. One of these batteries serves
to supply current to the tip and sleeve strand of the cord circuit
through the two windings <i>3</i> and <i>4</i>, respectively, of the supervisory
relay connected with the answering side of the cord circuit, while the
other battery similarly supplies current through the windings <i>5</i> and <i>6</i>
of the supervisory relay associated with the calling side of the cord
circuit. The windings of these relays, therefore, act as impedance
coils and the arrangement by which battery current is supplied to
the cord circuits and, therefore, to the lines of the connected subscribers,
is seen to be the combined impedance coil and condenser arrangement
discussed in Chapter XIII.</p>

<p>As soon as a plug is inserted into the jack of a line, the line
relay will be removed from the control of the line, and since the
two strands of the cord circuit now form continuations of the two
line conductors, the supervisory relay will be substituted for the line
relay and will be under control of the line. Since all of the current
which passes to the line after a plug is inserted must pass through
the cord-circuit connection and through the relay windings, and since
current can only flow through the line when the subscriber's receiver
is off its hook, it follows that the supervisory relays will only
be energized after the corresponding plug has been inserted into a
jack of the line and after the subscriber has removed his receiver.
Unlike the line relays, the supervisory relays open their contacts
to break the local circuits of the supervisory lamps <i>7</i> and <i>8</i> when
the relay coils are energized, and to close them when de-energized; but
the armatures of the supervisory relays do alone control the circuits
of the supervisory lamps. These circuits are normally held open in
another place, that is, between the plug contacts <i>1</i> and the jack
thimbles. It is only, therefore, when a plug is inserted into a jack
and when the supervisory relay is de-energized, that the supervisory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Page 23]</a></span>lamp may be lighted. When a plug is inserted into a jack and
when the corresponding supervisory relay is de-energized, the circuit
may be traced from ground at the cord-circuit batteries through the
left-hand battery, for instance, through lamp <i>7</i>, thence through the
contacts of the supervisory relay to the contact <i>1</i> of the plug, thence
through the thimble of the jack to ground. When a plug is inserted
into the jack, therefore, the necessary arrangements are completed for
the supervisory lamp to be under the control of the subscriber. Under
this condition, whenever the subscriber's receiver is on its hook, the
circuit of the line will be broken, the supervisory relay will be de-energized,
and the supervisory lamp will be lighted. When, on the
other hand, the subscriber's receiver is off its hook, the circuit of
the line will be complete, the supervisory relay will be energized,
and the supervisory lamp will be extinguished.</p>

<p><i>Salient Features of Supervisory Operation.</i> It will facilitate
the student's understanding of the requirements and mode of operation
of common-battery supervisory signals in manual systems,
whether simple or multiple, if he will firmly fix the following facts
in his mind. In order that the supervisory signal may become operative
at all, some act must be performed by the operator&mdash;this being
usually the act of plugging into a jack&mdash;and then, until the connection
is taken down, the supervisory signal is under the control of the
subscriber, and it is displayed only when the subscriber's receiver
is placed on its hook.</p>

<p><i>Cycle of Operations.</i> We may now trace through the complete
cycle of operations of the simple common-battery switchboard, the
circuits of which are shown in Fig. 314. Assume all apparatus in
its normal condition, and then assume that the subscriber at Station
A removes his receiver from its hook. This pulls up the line relay
and lights the line lamp, the pilot relay also pulling up and lighting
the common pilot lamp which is not shown. In response to this
call, the operator inserts the answering plug and throws her listening
key <i>L.K.</i> The operator's talking set is thus bridged across the cord
circuit and she is enabled to converse with the calling subscriber.
The answering supervisory lamp <i>7</i> did not light when the operator
inserted the answering plug into the jack, because, although the
contacts in the lamp circuit were closed by the plug contact <i>1</i> engaging
the thimble of the jack, the lamp circuit was held open by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Page 24]</a></span>attraction of the supervisory relay armature, the subscriber's receiver
being off its hook. Learning that the called-for subscriber is the one
at Station B, the operator inserts the calling plug into the jack at
that station and presses the ringing key <i>R.K.</i>, in order to ring the
bell. The act of plugging in, it will be remembered, cuts off the
line-signaling apparatus from connection with that line. As the
subscriber at Station B was not at his telephone when called and his
receiver was, therefore, on its hook, the insertion of the calling plug
did not energize the supervisory relay coils <i>5</i> and <i>6</i>, and, therefore,
that relay did not attract its armature. The supervisory lamp <i>8</i>
was thus lighted, the circuit being from ground through the right-hand
cord-circuit battery, lamp <i>8</i>, back contacts of the supervisory
relay, third strand of the cord to contact <i>1</i> of the calling plug, and
thence to ground through the thimble of the jack. The lighting of
this lamp is continued until the party at Station B responds by removing
his receiver from its hook, which completes the line circuit,
energizes relay windings <i>5</i> and <i>6</i>, causes that relay to attract its
armature, and thus break the circuit of the lamp <i>8</i>. Both supervisory
lamps remain out as long as the two subscribers are conversing,
but when either one of them hangs up his receiver the corresponding
supervisory relay becomes de-energized and the corresponding lamp
lights. When both of the lamps become illuminated, the operator
knows that both subscribers are through talking and she takes down
the connection.</p>

<p>Countless variations have been worked in the arrangement
of the line and cord circuits, but the general mode of operation of
this particular circuit chosen for illustration is standard and should
be thoroughly mastered. The operation of other arrangements
will be readily understood from an inspection of the circuits, once
the fundamental mode of operation that is common to all of them
is well in mind.</p>

<p><b>Lamps.</b> The incandescent lamps used in connection with line
and supervisory signals are specially manufactured, but differ in no
sense from the larger lamps employed for general lighting purposes,
save in the details of size, form, and method of mounting. Usually
these lamps are rated at about one-third candle-power, although
they have a somewhat larger candle-power as a rule. They are
manufactured to operate on various voltages, the most usual operating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Page 25]</a></span>pressures being 12, 24, and 48 volts. The 24-volt lamp consumes
about one-tenth of an ampere when fully illuminated, the lamp thus
consuming about 2.4 watts. The 12- and 48-volt lamps consume
about the same amount of energy and corresponding amounts of
current.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Lamp Mounting.</i> The usual
form of screw-threaded mounting
employed in lamps for commercial
lighting was at first applied to the
miniature lamps used for switchboard work,
but this was found unsatisfactory and these lamps are
now practically always provided with two contact strips, one on
each side of the glass bulb, these strips forming respectively the
terminals for the two ends of the filament within. Such a construction
of a common form of lamp is shown in Fig. 315, where these
terminals are indicated by the numerals <i>1</i> and <i>2</i>, <i>3</i> being a dry
wooden block arranged between the terminals at one end for securing
greater rigidity between them.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig316_t.jpg" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 316. Line Lamp Mounting</b><br />
<a href="images/fig316.jpg">View full size illustration.</a>
</div>

<p>The method of mounting these lamps is subject to a good deal
of variation in detail, but the arrangement is always such that the
lamp is slid in between two metallic contacts forming terminals of
the circuit in which the lamp is to operate. Such an arrangement
of springs and the co-operating mounting forming a sort of socket
for the reception of switchboard lamps is referred to as a <i>lamp jack</i>.
These are sometimes individually mounted and sometimes mounted
in strips in much the same way that jacks are mounted in strips.
A strip of lamp jacks as manufactured by the Kellogg Company is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Page 26]</a></span>shown in Fig. 316. The opalescent lens is adapted to be fitted in
front of the lamp after it has been inserted into the jack. Fig. 317
gives an excellent view of an individually-mounted lamp jack with
its lamp and lens, this also being of Kellogg
manufacture. This figure shows a section of
the plug shelf which is bored to receive a
lamp. In order to protect the lamps and
lenses from breakage, due to the striking of
the plugs against them, a metal shield is
placed over the lens, as shown in this figure,
this being so cut away as to allow sufficient
openings for the light to shine through. Sometimes
instead of employing lenses in front of
the lamps, a flat piece of translucent material is
used to cover the openings of the lamp, this
being protected by suitable perforated strips
of metal. A strip of lamp jacks employing
this feature is shown in Fig. 318, this being of
Dean manufacture. An advantage of this for
certain types of work is that the flat translucent
plate in front of the lamp may readily carry designating marks,
such as the number of the line or something to indicate the character
of the line, which marks may be readily changed as required.</p>

<p>In the types made by some manufacturers the only difference
between the pilot lamp and the line lamp is in the size of the lens in
front of it, the jack and the lamp itself being the same for each, while
others use a larger lamp for the pilot. In Fig. 319 are shown two individual
lamp jacks, the one at the top being for supervisory lamps
and the one at the bottom being provided with a large lens for serving
as a pilot lamp.</p>

<p><b>Mechanical Signals.</b> As has been stated the so-called mechanical
signals are sometimes used in small common-battery switchboards
instead of lamps. Where this is done the coil of the signal,
if it is a line signal, is substituted in the line circuit in place of the
relay coil. If the signals are used in connection with cord circuits
for supervisory signals, their coils are put in the circuit in place of the
supervisory relay coils. (These signals are referred to in Chapter
III in connection with Fig. 23.) They are so arranged that the
attraction of the armature lifts a target on the end of a lever, and this
causes a display of color or form. The release of the armature allows
this target to drop back, thus obliterating the display. Such signals,
often called <i>visual signals</i> and <i>electromagnet signals</i>, should be distinguished
from the drops considered in connection with magneto
switchboards in which the attraction of the armature causes the
display of the signal by the falling of a drop, the signal remaining
displayed until restored by some other means, the restoration depending
in no wise on when the armature is released.</p>

<p><i>Western Electric.</i> The mechanical signal of the Western Electric
Company, shown in Fig. 320, has a target similar to that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Page 28]</a></span>shown in Fig. 254 but without a latch. It is turned to show a different
color by the attraction of the armature and allowed to resume
its normal position when the armature is released.</p>

<p><i>Kellogg.</i> Fig. 321 gives a good idea of a strip of mechanical
signals as manufactured by the Kellogg Company. This is known
as the <i>gridiron</i> signal on account of the cross-bar striping of its
target. The white bars on the target normally lie just behind the
cross-bars on the shield in front, but a slight raising of the target&mdash;about
one-eighth of an inch&mdash;exposes these white bars to view,
opposite the rectangular openings in the front shield.</p>

<p><b>Relays.</b> The line relays for common-battery switchboards
likewise assume a great variety of forms. The well-known type of
relay employed in telegraphy would answer the purpose well but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Page 29]</a></span>for the amount of room that it occupies, as it is sometimes necessary
to group a large number of relays in a very small space. Nearly all
present-day relays are of the single-coil type, and in nearly all cases
the movement of the armature causes the movement of one or more
switching springs, which are thus made to engage or disengage their
associated spring or springs. One of the most widely used forms
of relays has an <b>L</b>-shaped armature hung across the front of a forwardly
projecting arm of iron, on the knife-edge corner of which it
rocks as moved by the attraction of the magnet. The general form
of this relay was illustrated in Fig. 95. Sometimes this relay is
made up in single units and frequently a large number of such single
units are mounted on a single mounting plate. This matter will
be dealt with more in detail in the discussion of common-battery
multiple switchboards. In other cases these relays are built <i>en
bloc</i>, a rectangular strip of soft iron long enough to afford space for
ten relays side by side being bored out with ten cylindrical holes to
receive the electromagnets. The iron of the block affords a return
path for the lines of force. The <b>L</b>-shaped armatures are hung over
the front edge of this block, so that their free ends lie opposite the
magnet cores within the block. This arrangement as employed by
the Kellogg Company is shown in two views in Figs. 323 and 324.</p>

<p><b>Jacks.</b> The jacks in common-battery switchboards are almost
always mounted in groups of ten or twenty, the arrangement being
similar to that discussed in connection with lamp strips. Ordinarily
in common-battery work the jack is provided with two inner contacts
so as to cut off both sides of the signaling circuit when the operator
plugs in. A strip of such jacks is shown in Fig. 326.</p>

<p>Ringing and listening keys for simple common-battery switchboards
differ in no essential respect from those employed in magneto
boards.</p>

<p><b>Switchboard Assembly.</b> The general assembly of the parts of
a simple common-battery switchboard deserves some attention. The
form of the switchboard need not differ essentially from that employed
in magneto work, but ordinarily the cabinet is somewhat
smaller on account of the smaller amount of room required by its
lamps and jacks. An excellent idea of the line jacks and lamps,
plugs, keys, and supervisory signals may be obtained from Fig. 327,
which is a detail view taken from a Kellogg board. In the vertical
panel of the board above the plug shelf are arranged the line jacks
and the lamps in rows of twenty each, each lamp being immediately
beneath its corresponding jack. Such jacks are ordinarily mounted
on <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>-inch centers both vertically and horizontally, so that a group
of one hundred lamps and line jacks will occupy a space only slightly
over 10 by 5 inches. Such economy of space is not required in the
simple magneto board, because the space might easily be made larger
without in any way taxing the reach of the operator. The reason for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Page 32]</a></span>this comparatively close mounting is a result, not of the requirements
of the simple non-multiple common-battery board itself, but
of the fact that the jack strips and lamp strips, which are required
in very large numbers in multiple boards, have to be mounted extremely
close together, and as the same lamp strips and jack strips
are often available for simple switchboards, an economy in manufacture
is effected by adherence to the same general dimensions.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>A rear view of a common form of switchboard cabinet, known
as the <i>upright type</i> and manufactured by the Dean Company, is shown
in Fig. 328. In this all the relays are mounted on a hinged rack, which,
when opened out as indicated, exposes the wiring to view for inspection
or repairs. Access to both sides of the relays is thus given
to the repairman who may do all his work from the rear of the board
without disturbing the operator.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Page 33]</a></span></p><p>Fig. 329 shows a three-position cabinet of Kellogg manufacture,
this being about the limit in size of boards that could properly be
called simple. Obviously, where a switchboard cabinet must be
made of greater length than this, <i>i. e.</i>, than is required to accommodate
three operators, it becomes too long for the operators to
reach all over it without undue effort or without moving from their
seats. The so-called <i>transfer board</i> and the <i>multiple board</i> (to be
considered in subsequent chapters), constitute methods of relief
from such a condition in larger exchanges.</p>

<span style="font-size:80%;">TRANSFER SWITCHBOARD</span></h2>


<p>When the traffic originating in a switchboard becomes so great
as to require so many operators that the board must be made so long
that any one of the operators cannot reach over its entire face, the
simple switchboard does not suffice. Either some form of transfer
switchboard or of multiple switchboard must be used. In this
chapter the transfer switchboard will be briefly discussed.</p>

<p>The transfer switchboard is so named because its arrangement
is such that some of the connections through it are handled by
means of two operators, the operator who answers the call transferring
it to another operator who completes the connection desired.</p>

<p><b>Limitations of Simple Switchboard.</b> Conceive a number of
simple magneto switchboards, or a number of common-battery
switchboards, arranged side by side, their number being so great as
to form, by their combination, a board too long for the ordinary cords
and plugs to reach between its extremities. On each of these simple
switchboards, which we will say are each of the one-position type,
there terminates a group of subscribers' lines so great in number,
considering the traffic on them, that the efforts of one operator will
just about be taxed to properly attend to their calls during the busiest
hours of the day. If, now, these subscribers would be sufficiently
accommodating to call for no other subscribers than those whose
lines terminate on the same switchboard section or on one of the
immediately adjacent switchboard sections, all would be well, but
subscribers will not be so restricted. They demand universal service;
that is, they demand the privilege of having their own lines connected
with the line of any other person in the exchange. Obviously,
in the arrangement just conceived, any operator may answer any
call originating at her own board and complete the connection with
the desired subscriber if that subscriber's jack terminates on her own
section or on one of the adjacent ones. Beyond that she is powerless
unless other means are provided.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Page 35]</a></span></p><p><b>Transfer Lines.</b> In the transfer board these other means consist
in the provision of groups of local trunk lines or transfer lines
extending from each switchboard position to each other non-adjacent
switchboard position. When an operator receives a call for some line
on a non-adjacent position, having answered this call with her answering
plug, she inserts the calling plug into the jack of one of these
transfer lines that leads to the proper other section. The operator
at that section is notified either verbally or by signal, and she completes
the connection between the other end of the transfer line and
the line of the called subscriber; the connection between the two subscribers
thus being effected through the cords of the two operators
in question linked together by the transfer line. Such a transfer
line as just described, requiring the connection at each of its ends
by one of the plugs of the operator's cord pair, is termed a <i>jack-ended
trunk</i> or a <i>jack-ended transfer line</i> because each of its ends
terminates in a jack.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>There is another method of accomplishing the same general
result by the employment of the so-called <i>plug-ended trunk</i> or
<i>plug-ended transfer line</i>. In this the trunk or transfer line terminates at
one end, the answering end, in a jack as before, and the connection
is made with it by the answering operator by means of the calling
plug of the pair with which she answered the originating call. The
other end of this trunk, instead of terminating in a jack, ends in a plug
and the second operator involved in the connection, after being notified,
picks up this plug and inserts it in the jack of the called subscriber,
thus completing the connection without employing one of
her regular cord pairs.</p>

<p><i>Jack-Ended Trunk.</i> In Fig. 330 are shown the circuits of a
commonly employed jack-ended trunk for transfer boards. The
talking circuit, as usual, is shown in heavy lines and terminates in
the tip and sleeve of the transfer jacks at each end. The auxiliary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Page 36]</a></span>contacts in these jacks and the circuits connecting them are absolutely
independent of the talking circuit and are for the purpose of signaling
only, the arrangement of the jacks being such that when a plug is
inserted, the spring <i>1</i> will break from spring <i>2</i> and make with spring
<i>3</i>. Obviously, the insertion of a plug in either of the jacks will
establish such connections as to light both lamps, since the engagement
of spring <i>1</i> with spring <i>3</i> in either of the jacks will connect both
of the lamps in multiple across the battery, this connection including
always the contacts <i>1</i> and <i>2</i> of the other jack. From this it follows
that the insertion of a plug in the other end of the trunk will,
by breaking contact between springs <i>1</i> and <i>2</i>, put out both the
lamps. One plug inserted will, therefore, light both lamps; two
plugs inserted or two plugs withdrawn will extinguish both lamps.</p>

<p>If an operator located at one end of this trunk answers a call
and finds that the called-for subscriber's line terminates within
reach of the operator near the other end of this trunk, she will
insert a calling plug, corresponding to the answering plug used in
answering a call, into the jack of this trunk and thus light the lamp
at both its ends. The operator at the other end upon seeing this
transfer lamp illuminated inserts one of her answering plugs into
the jack, and by means of her listening key ascertains the number
of the subscriber desired, and immediately inserts her calling plug
into the jack of the subscriber wanted and rings him in the usual
manner. The act of this second operator in inserting her answering
plug into the jack extinguishes the lamp at her own end and
also at the end where the call originated, thus notifying the answering
operator that the call has been attended to. As long as the
lamps remain lighted, the operators know that there is an unattended
connection on that transfer line. Such a transfer line is called a
<i>two-way</i> line or a <i>single-track</i> line, because traffic over it may be in
either direction. In Fig. 331 is shown a trunk that operates in a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Page 37]</a></span>similar way except that the two lamps, instead of being arranged
in multiple, are arranged in series.</p>

<br /><b>Fig. 332. Jack- and Plug-Ended Transfer Circuit</b><br />

<p><i>Plug-Ended Trunk.</i> In Fig. 332 is shown a plug-ended trunk,
this particular arrangement of circuits being employed by the Monarch
Company in its transfer boards. This is essentially a one-way
trunk, and traffic over it can pass only in the direction of the
arrow. Traffic in the opposite direction between any two operators
is handled by another trunk or group of trunks similar to this
but "pointed" in the other direction. For this reason such a system
is referred to as a <i>double-track</i> system. The operation of signals is
the same in this case as in Fig. 330, except that the switching device
at the left-hand end of the trunk instead of being associated with
the jack is associated with the plug seat, which is a switch closely
associated with the seat of a plug so as to be operated whenever
the plug is withdrawn from or replaced in its seat. The operation
of this arrangement is as follows: Whenever an operator at the right-hand
end of this trunk receives a call for a subscriber whose line
terminates within the reach of the operator at the left-hand end of
the trunk, she inserts the calling plug of the pair used in answering
the calling subscriber into the jack of the trunk, and thus lights both
of the trunk lamps. The operator at the other end of the trunk,
seeing the trunk lamp lighted, raises the plug from its seat and, having
learned the wishes of the calling subscriber, inserts this plug into
the jack of the called subscriber without using one of her regular
pairs. When she raised the trunk plug from its seat, she permitted
the long spring <i>1</i> of the plug seat switch to rise, thus extinguishing
both lamps and giving the signal to the originating operator that
the trunk connection has received attention. On taking down the
connection, the withdrawal of the plug from the right hand of the
trunk lights both lamps, and the restoring of the trunk plug to its
normal seat again extinguishes both lamps.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Page 38]</a></span></p><p><b>Plug-Seat Switch.</b> The plug-seat switch is a device that has
received a good deal of attention not only for use with transfer systems,
but also for use in a great variety of ways with other kinds of
manual switching systems. The placing of a plug in its seat or
withdrawing it therefrom offers a ready means of accomplishing
some switching or signaling operation automatically. The plug-seat
switch has, however, in spite of its possibilities, never come into
wide use, and so far as we are aware the Monarch Telephone Manufacturing
Company is the only company of prominence which incorporates
it in its regular output. The Monarch plug-switch mechanism
is shown in Fig. 333, and its operation is obvious. It may be
stated at this point that one of the reasons why the plug-seat switch
has not been more widely adopted for use, is the difficulty that has
been experienced due to lint from the switchboard cords collecting
on or about the contact points. In the construction given in the
detailed cut, upper part, Fig. 333, is shown the means adopted by
the Monarch Company for obviating this difficulty. The contact
points are carried in the upper portion of an inverted cup mounted
on the under side of the switchboard shelf, and are thus protected,
in large measure, from the damaging influence of dust and lint.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Handling Transfers.</b> One way of giving the number
of the called subscriber to the second operator in a transfer system
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Page 39]</a></span>is to have that operator listen in on the circuit after it is continued
to her position and receive the number either from the first operator
or from the subscriber. Receiving it from the first operator has the
disadvantage of compelling the first operator to wait on the circuit
until the second operator responds; receiving it from the subscriber
has the disadvantage of sometimes being annoying to him. This,
however, is to be preferred to the loss of time on the part of the
originating operator that is entailed by the first method. A better
way than either of these is to provide between the various operators
working in a transfer system, a so-called <i>order-wire</i> system. An
order wire, as ordinarily arranged, is a circuit terminating at one
end permanently in the head receiver of an operator, and terminating
at the other end in a push button which, when depressed, will connect
the telephone set of the operator at that end with the order wire.
The operator at the push-button end of the order wire may, therefore,
at will, communicate with the other operator in spite of anything
that the other operator may do. An order-wire system suitable
for transfer switchboards consists in an order wire leading
from each operator's receiver to a push button at each of the other
operator's positions, so that every operator has it within her power to
depress a key or button and establish communication with a corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Page 40]</a></span>operator. When, therefore, an operator in a transfer
system answers a call that must be completed through a transfer
circuit, she establishes connection with that transfer circuit and
then informs the operator at the other end of that circuit by order
wire of the number of the trunk and the number of the subscriber
with which that trunk is to be connected. Fig. 334 shows a system
of order-wire buttons by means of which each operator may connect
her telephone set with that of every other operator in the room, the
number in this case being confined to three. Assuming that each
pair of wires leading from the lower portion of this figure terminates
respectively in the operator's talking apparatus of the three respective
operators, then it is obvious that operator No. 1, by depressing
button No. 2, will connect her telephone set with that of
operator No. 2; likewise that any operator may communicate with
any other operator by depressing the key bearing the corresponding
number.</p>

<p><b>Limitations of Transfer System.</b> It may be stated that the
transfer system at present has a limited place in the art of telephony.
The multiple switchboard has outstripped it in the race for popular
approval and has demonstrated its superiority in practically all
large manual exchange work. This is not because of lack of effort
on the part of telephone engineers to make the transfer system a
success in a broad way. A great variety of different schemes, all
embodying the fundamental idea of having one operator answer the
call and another operator complete it through a trunk line, have
been tried. In San Francisco, the Sabin-Hampton system was in
fairly successful service and served many thousands of lines for a
number of years. It was, however, afterwards replaced by modern
multiple switchboards.</p>

<p><i>Examples of Obsolete Systems.</i> The Sabin-Hampton system
was unique in many respects and involved three operators in each
connection. It was one of the very first systems which employed
automatic signaling throughout and did away with the subscribers'
generators. It did not, however, dispense with the subscribers'
local batteries.</p>

<p>Another large transfer system, used for years in an exchange
serving at a time as many as 5,000, was employed at Grand Rapids,
Michigan. This was later replaced by an automatic switchboard.</p>

<p><b>Field of Usefulness.</b> The real field of utility for the transfer
system today is to provide for the growth of simple switchboards
that have extended beyond their originally intended limits. By the
adding of additional sections to the simple switchboard and the establishment
of a comparatively cheap transfer system, the simple boards
may be made to do continued service without wasting the investment
in them by discarding them and establishing a completely new system.
However, switchboards are sometimes manufactured in which
the transfer system is included as a part of the original equipment.
In Fig. 335 is shown a three-position transfer switchboard, manufactured
by the Monarch Telephone Company. At first glance the
switchboard appears to be exactly like those described in Chapter
XXI, but on close observation, the transfer jacks and signals may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Page 42]</a></span>be seen in the first and third positions, just below the line jacks and
signals. There is no transfer equipment in the second position of
this switchboard because the operator at that position is able to reach
the jacks of all the lines and, therefore, is able to complete all calls
originating on her position without the use of any transfer equipment.
Referring to Fig. 301, which illustrates a two-position simple
switchboard, it may readily be seen that if the demands for telephone
service in the locality in which this switchboard is installed
should increase so as to require the addition of more switchboard
positions, this switchboard could readily be converted to a transfer
switchboard by placing the necessary transfer jacks and signals in
the vacant space between the line jacks and clearing-out drops.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXIV<br />

<span style="font-size:80%;">PRINCIPLES OF THE MULTIPLE SWITCHBOARD</span></h2>


<p><b>Field of Utility.</b> The multiple switchboard, unlike the transfer
board, provides means for each operator to complete, without
assistance, a connection with any subscriber's line terminating in
the switchboard no matter how great the number of lines may be.
It is used only where the simple switchboard will not suffice; that is,
where the number of lines and the consequent traffic is so great as
to require so many operators and, therefore, so great a length of
board as to make it impossible for any one operator to reach all over
the face of the board without moving from her position.</p>

<p><b>The Multiple Feature.</b> The fundamental feature of the multiple
switchboard is the placing of a jack for every line served by the
switchboard within the reach of every operator. This idea underlying
the multiple switchboard may be best grasped by merely
considering the mechanical arrangement and grouping of parts
without regard to their details of operation. The idea is sometimes
elusive, but it is really very simple. If the student at the outset will not
be frightened by the very large number of parts that are sometimes
involved in multiple switchboards, and by the great complexity
which is apparent in the wiring and in the action of these parts; and
will remember that this apparent complexity results from the great
number of repetitions of the same comparatively simple group of
apparatus and circuits, much will be done toward a mastery of the
subject.</p>

<p>The multiple switchboard is divided into sections, each section
being about the width and height that will permit an ordinary operator
to reach conveniently all over its face. The usual width of a
section brought about by this limitation is from five and one-half to
six feet. Such a section affords room for three operators to sit side
by side before it. Now each line, instead of having a single jack
as in the simple switchboard, is provided with a number of jacks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Page 44]</a></span>and one of these is placed on each of the sections, so that each one
of the operators may have within her reach a jack for each line.
It is from the fact that each line has a multiplicity of jacks, that the
term multiple switchboard arises.</p>

<p><i>Number of Sections.</i> Since there is a jack for each line on each
section of the switchboard, it follows that on each section there are as
many jacks as there are lines; that is, if the board were serving 5,000
lines there would be 5,000 jacks. Let us see now what it is that
determines the number of sections in a multiple switchboard. In
the final analysis, it is the amount of traffic that arises in the busiest
period of the day. Assume that in a particular office serving 5,000
lines, the subscribers call at such a very low rate that even at the
busiest time of the day only enough calls are made to keep, say, three
operators busy. In this case there would be no need for the multiple
switchboard, for a single section would suffice. The three
operators seated before that section would be able to answer and
complete the connections for all of the calls that arose. But subscribers
do not call at this exceedingly low rate. A great many more
calls would arise on 5,000 lines during the busiest hour than could
be handled by three operators and, therefore, a great many more
operators would be required. Space has to be provided for these
operators to work in, and as each section accommodates three operators
the total number of sections must be at least equal to the total
number of required operators divided by three.</p>

<p>Let us assume, for instance, that each operator can handle 200
calls during the busy hour. Assume further that during the busy
hour the average number of calls made by each subscriber is two.
One hundred subscribers would, therefore, originate 200 calls within
this busy hour and this would be just sufficient to keep one operator
busy. Since one operator can handle only the calls of one hundred
subscribers during the busy hour, it follows that as many operators
must be employed as there are hundreds of subscribers whose lines
are served in a switchboard, and this means that in an exchange of
5,000 subscribers, 50 operators' positions would be required, or 16<span class="frac"><sup>2</sup>/<sub>3</sub></span>
sections. Each of these sections would be equipped with the full
5,000 jacks, so that each operator could have a connection terminal
for each line.</p>

<p><i>The Multiple.</i> These groups of 5,000 jacks, repeated on each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Page 45]</a></span>of the sections are termed multiple jacks, and the entire equipment
of these multiple jacks and their wiring is referred to as the multiple.
It will be shown presently that the multiple jacks are only used for
enabling the operator to connect with the called subscriber. In
other words these jacks are for the purpose of enabling each operator
to have within her reach any line that may be called for regardless
of what line originates the call. We will now consider what
arrangements are provided for enabling the operator to receive the
signal indicating a call and what provisions are made for her to answer
the call in response to such a signal.</p>

<p><b>Line Signals.</b> Obviously it is not necessary to have the line
signals repeated on each section of the board as are the multiple jacks.
If a line has one definite place on the switchboard where its signal
may be received and its call may be answered, that suffices. Each
line, therefore, in addition to having its multiple jacks distributed
one on each section of the switchboard, has a line signal and an
individual jack immediately associated with it, located on one only
of the sections. This signal usually is in the form of a lamp and
is termed the line signal, and this jack is termed the answering jack
since it is by means of it that the operator always answers a call in
response to the line signal.</p>

<p><i>Distribution of Line Signals.</i> It is evident that it would not
do to have all of these line signals and answering jacks located at
one section of the board for then they would not be available to all
of the operators. They are, therefore, distributed along the board
in such a way that one group of them will be available to one
operator, another group to another operator, and so on; the number
of answering jacks and signals in any one group being so proportioned
with respect to the number of calls that come in over
them during the busy hour that it will afford just about enough
calls to keep the operator at that position busy.</p>

<p>We may summarize these conditions with respect to the jack and
line-signal equipment of the multiple switchboard by saying that
each line has a multiple jack on each section of the board and in
addition to this has on one section of the board an answering jack
and a line signal. These answering jacks and line signals are distributed
in groups along the face of the board so that each operator
will receive her proper quota of the originating calls which she will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Page 46]</a></span>answer and, by virtue of the multiple jack, be able to complete the
connections with the desired subscribers without moving from her
position.</p>

<p><b>Cord Circuits.</b> Each operator is also provided with a number
of pairs of cords and plugs with proper supervisory or clearing-out
signals and ringing and listening keys, the arrangement in this respect
being similar to that already described in connection with the
simple switchboard.</p>

<p><b>Guarding against Double Connections.</b> From what has been
said it is seen that a call originating on a given line may be answered
at one place only, but an outgoing connection with that line may
be made at any position. This fact that a line may be connected
with when called for at any one of the sections of the switchboard
makes necessary the provision that two or more connections will not
be made with the same line at the same time. For instance, if a call
came in over a line whose signal was located on the first position of
the switchboard for a connection with line No. 1,000, the operator
at the first position would connect this calling line with No. 1,000
through the multiple jack on the first section of the switchboard.
Assume now that some line, whose signal was located on the 39th
position of the switchboard, should call also for line No. 1,000 while
that line was still connected with the first calling subscriber.
Obviously confusion would result if the operator at the 39th position,
not knowing that line No. 1,000 was already busy, should connect this
second line with it, thereby leaving both of the calling subscribers
connected with line No. 1,000, and as a result all of these three subscribers
connected together.</p>

<p>The provisions for suitable means for preventing the making
of a connection with a line that is already switched at some other
section of the switchboard, has offered one of the most fertile fields
for invention in the whole telephone art. The ways that have been
proposed for accomplishing this are legion. Fortunately common
practice has settled on one general plan of action and that is to so
arrange the circuits that whenever a line is switched at one section,
such an electrical condition will be established on the forward contacts
of all of its multiple jacks that any operator at any other section
in attempting to make a connection with that line will be notified
of the fact that it is already switched by an audible signal, which she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Page 47]</a></span>will receive in her head receiver. On the other hand the arrangement
is such that when a line is not busy, <i>i. e.</i>, it is not switched at
any of the positions of the switchboard, the operator on attempting
to make a connection with such a line will receive no such guarding
signal and will, therefore, proceed with the connection.</p>

<p>We may liken a line in a multiple switchboard to a lane having
a number of gates giving access to it. One of these gates&mdash;the
answering jack&mdash;is for the exclusive use of the proprietor of that lane.
All of the other gates to the lane&mdash;the multiple jacks&mdash;are for affording
means for the public to enter. But whenever any person enters
one of these gates, a signal is automatically put up at all of the
other gates forbidding any other person to enter the lane as long as
the first person is still within.</p>

<br /><b>Fig. 336. Principle of Multiple Switchboard</b><br />
<a href="images/fig336.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><b>Diagram Showing Multiple Board Principle.</b> For those to whom
the foregoing description of the multiple board is not altogether clear,
the diagram of Fig. 336 may offer some assistance. Five subscribers'
lines are shown running through four sections of a switchboard.
Each of these lines is provided with a multiple jack on each section
of the board. Each line is also provided with an answering jack and
a line signal on one of the sections of the board. Thus the answering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Page 48]</a></span>jacks and the line signals of lines <i>1</i> and <i>2</i> are shown in Section
I, that of line <i>4</i> is shown in Section II, that of line <i>3</i> in Section III,
and that of line <i>5</i> in Section IV. At Section I, line <i>1</i> is shown in the
condition of having made a call and having had this call answered
by the operator inserting one of her plugs into its answering jack.
In response to the instructions given by the subscriber, the operator
has inserted the other plug of this same pair in the multiple jack
of line <i>2</i>, thus connecting these two lines for conversation. At Section
III, line <i>3</i> is shown as having made a call, and the operator as
having answered by inserting one of her plugs into the answering
jack. It happens that the subscriber on line <i>3</i> requests a connection
with line <i>1</i>, and the condition at Section III is that where the
operator is about to apply the tip of the calling plug to the jack of
line <i>1</i> to ascertain whether or not that line is busy. As before stated,
when the contact is made between the tip of the calling plug and the
forward contact of the multiple jack, the operator will receive a click
in the ear (by means that will be more fully discussed in later chapters),
this click indicating to her that line <i>1</i> is not available for
connection because it is already switched at some other section of the
switchboard.</p>

<p><b>Busy Test.</b> The busy signal, by which an operator in attempting
to make a connection is informed that the line is already busy,
has assumed a great variety of forms and has brought forth many
inventions. It has been proposed by some that the insertion of a
plug into any one of the jacks of a line would automatically close a
little door in front of each of the other jacks of the line, therefore
making it impossible for any other operator to insert a plug as long
as the line is in use. It has been proposed by others to ring bells
or to operate buzzers whenever the attempt was made by an operator
to plug into a line that was already in use. Still others have proposed
to so arrange the circuits that the operator would get an electric
shock whenever she attempted to plug into a busy line. The scheme
that has met with universal adoption, however, is that the operator
shall, when the tip of her calling plug touches the forward contact of
the jack of a line that is already switched, receive a click in her telephone
which will forbid her to insert the plug. The absence of this
click, or silence in her telephone, informs her that she may safely
make the connection.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Page 49]</a></span></p><p><i>Principle.</i> The means by which the operator receives or fails
to receive this click, according to whether the line is busy or idle,
vary widely, but so far as the writers are aware they all have one
fundamental feature in common. The tip of the calling plug and the
test contact of all of the multiple jacks of an idle line must be absolutely
at the same potential before the test, so that no current will
flow through the test circuit when the test is actually made. The
test thimbles of all the jacks of a busy line must be at a different
potential from the tip of the test plug so that a current will flow and
a click result when the test is made.</p>

<p><i>Potential of Test Thimbles.</i> It has been found an easy matter
to so arrange the contacts in the jacks of a multiple switchboard that
whenever the line is idle the test thimbles of that line will be a certain
potential, the same as that of all the unused calling plug tips.
It has also been easy to so arrange these contacts that the insertion of
a plug into any one of the jacks will, by virtue of the contacts established,
change the potential of all the test thimbles of that line so
that they will be at a different potential from that of the tips of the
calling plugs. It has not been so easy, however, to provide that these
conditions shall exist under all conditions of practice. A great many
busy tests that looked well on paper have been found faulty in practice.
As is always the case in such instances, this has been true
because the people who considered the scheme on paper did not
foresee all of the conditions that would arise in practice. Many
busy-test systems will operate properly while everything connected
with the switchboard and the lines served by it remains in proper
order. But no such condition as this can be depended on in practice.
Switchboards, no matter how perfectly made and no matter
with how great care they may be installed and maintained, will get
out of order. Telephone lines will become grounded or short-circuited
or crossed or opened. Such conditions, in a faulty busy-test
system, may result in a line that is really idle presenting a busy
test, and thus barring the subscriber on that line from receiving calls
from other lines just as completely as if his line were broken. On
the other hand, faulty conditions either in the switchboard or in
the line may make a line that is really busy, test idle, and thus result
in the confusion of having two or more subscribers connected to the
same line at the same time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Page 50]</a></span></p><p><i>Busy-Test Faults.</i> To show how elusive some of the faults of
a busy test may be, when considered on paper, it has come within
the observation of the writers that a new busy-test system was thought
well enough of by a group of experienced engineers to warrant its
installation in a group of very large multiple switchboards, the cost
of which amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars, and yet when
so installed it developed that a single short-circuited cord in a position
would make the test inoperative on all the cords of that position&mdash;obviously
an intolerable condition. Luckily the remedy was simple
and easily applied.</p>

<p>In a well-designed busy-test system there should be complete
silence when the test is made of an idle line, and always a well-defined
click when the test is made of a busy line. The test on busy
lines should result in a uniform click regardless of length of lines
or the condition of the apparatus. It does not suffice to have a little
click for an idle line and a big click for a busy line, as practice has
shown that this results in frequent errors on the part of the operators.</p>

<p>Good operating requires that the tip of the calling plug be
tapped against the test thimble several times in order to make sure
of the state of the called line.</p>

<p>In some multiple switchboards the arrangement has been such
that the jacks of a line would test busy as soon as the subscriber
on that line removed his receiver from its hook to make a call, as
well as while any plug was in any jack of that line. The advocates
of this added feature, in connection with the busy test, have claimed
that the receiver, when removed from its hook in making a call,
should make the line test busy and that a line should not be connected
with when the subscriber's receiver was off its hook any more than
it should be when it was already connected with at some other section
of the switchboard. While it is true that a line may be properly
termed busy when the subscriber has removed his receiver in order
to make a call, it is not true that there is any real necessity for guarding
against a connection with it while he is waiting for the operator
to answer. Leaving the line unguarded for this brief period may
result in the subscriber, who intended to make the call, having to
defer his call until he has conversed with the party who is trying to
reach him. This cannot be said to be a detriment to the service,
however, since the second party gets the connection he desires much
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Page 51]</a></span>sooner than he otherwise would, and the first party may still make
his first intended call as soon as he has disposed of the party who
reached him while he was waiting for his own operator to answer. It
may be said, therefore, in connection with this matter of making the
line test busy as soon as a subscriber has removed his receiver from
the hook, that it is not considered an essential, and in case of those
switchboard systems which naturally work out that way it is not
considered a disadvantage.</p>

<p><b>Field of Each Operator.</b> It was stated earlier in this chapter
that as each section accommodated three operators, the total number
of sections in a switchboard will be at least one-third the total number
of required operators. This thought needs further development,
for to stop at that statement is to arrive somewhat short of the truth.
In order to do this it is necessary to consider the field in the multiple,
reached by each operator. The section is of such size, or should
be, that an operator seated in the center position of it may, without
undue effort, reach all over the multiple. But the operator at the
right-hand position cannot reach the extreme left portion of the multiple
of that section, nor can the operator at the left reach the extreme
right. How then may each operator reach a jack for every
line? Remembering that the multiple jacks are arranged exactly
the same in each section, each jack always occupying the same relative
position, it is easy to see that while the operator at a right-hand
position of a section cannot reach the left-hand third of the multiple
in her own section, she may reach the left-hand third of the multiple
in the section at her right, and this, together with the center and
right-hand thirds of her own section, represents the entire number
of lines. So it is with the left-hand operator at any section, she
reaches two-thirds of all the lines in the multiple of her own section
and one-third in that of the section at her left.</p>

<p><i>End Positions.</i> This makes it necessary to inquire about the
operators at the end positions of the entire board. To provide for
these the multiple is extended one-third of a section beyond them,
so as to supply at the ends of the switchboard jacks for those lines
which the end operators cannot reach on their own sections. Sometimes
instead of adding these end sections to the multiple for the
end operators, the same result is accomplished by using only the full
and regular sections of the multiple, and leaving the end positions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Page 52]</a></span>without operators' equipment, as well as without answering jacks,
line signals, and cords and plugs, so that in reality the end operator
is at the middle position of the end section. This, in our opinion,
is the better practice, since it leaves the sections standard, and makes
it easier to extend the switchboard in length, as it grows, by the
mere addition of new sections without disturbing any of the old
multiple.</p>

<p><b>Influence of Traffic.</b> We wish again to emphasize the fact that
it is the traffic during the busiest time of day and not the number
of lines that determine the size of a multiple switchboard so far as its
length is concerned. The number of lines determines the size of
the multiple in any one section, but it is the amount of traffic, the
number of calls that are made in the busiest period, that determines
the number of operators required, and thus the number of positions.
Had this now very obvious fact been more fully realized in the past,
some companies would be operating at less expense, and some manufacturers
would have sold less expensive switchboards.</p>

<p>The whole question as to the number of positions boils down
to how many answering jacks and line signals may be placed
at each operator's position without overburdening the operator with
incoming traffic at the busy time of day. Obviously, some lines will
call more frequently than others, and hence the proper number of
answering jacks at the different positions will vary. Obviously, also,
due to changes in the personnel of the subscribers, the rates of calling
of different groups of lines will change from time to time, and this
may necessitate a regrouping of the line signals and answering jacks
on the positions; and changes in the personnel of the operators or
in their skill also demand such regrouping.</p>

<p><i>Intermediate Frame.</i> The intermediate distributing frame is
provided for this purpose, and will be more fully discussed in subsequent
chapters. Suffice it to say here that the intermediate distributing
frame permits the answering jacks and line signals to be
shifted about among the operators' positions, so that each position
will have just enough originating traffic to keep each of the operators
economically busy during the busiest time of the day.</p>

<span style="font-size:80%;">THE MAGNETO MULTIPLE SWITCHBOARD</span></h2>


<p><b>Field of Utility.</b> The principles of the multiple switchboard
set forth in the last chapter were all developed long before the common-battery
system came into existence, and consequently all of the
first multiple switchboards were of the magneto type. Although
once very widely used, the magneto multiple switchboard has almost
passed out of existence, since it has become almost universal practice
to equip exchanges large enough to employ multiple boards
with common-battery systems. Nevertheless there is a field for
magneto multiple switchboards, and in this field it has recently been
coming into increasing favor. In those towns equipped with magneto
systems employing simple switchboards or transfer switchboards,
and which require new switchboards by virtue of having
outgrown or worn out their old ones, the magneto multiple switchboard
is frequently found to best fit the requirements of economy
and good practice. The reason for this is that by its use the magneto
telephones already in service may be continued, no change
being required outside of the central office. Furthermore, with
the magneto multiple switchboard no provision need be made for a
power plant, which, in towns of small size, is often an important
consideration. Again, many companies operate over a considerable
area, involving a collection of towns and hamlets. It may be that all
of these towns except one are clearly of a size to demand magneto
equipment and that magneto equipment is the standard throughout
the entire territory of the company. If, however, one of the towns,
by virtue of growth, demands a multiple switchboard, this condition
affords an additional argument for the employment of the magneto
multiple switchboard, since the same standards of equipment and
construction may be maintained throughout the entire territory of
the operating company, a manifest advantage. On the other hand,
it may be said that the magneto multiple switchboard has no proper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Page 54]</a></span>place in modern exchanges of considerable size&mdash;say, having upward
of one thousand subscribers&mdash;at least under conditions found in the
United States.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the obsolescence of the magneto multiple
switchboard for large exchanges, a brief discussion of some of the
early magneto multiple switchboards, and particularly of one of the
large ones, is worth while, in that a consideration of the defects of
those early efforts will give one a better understanding and appreciation
of the modern multiple switchboard, and particularly of the
modern multiple common-battery switchboard, the most highly
organized of all the manual switching systems. Brief reference will,
therefore, be made to the so-called series multiple switchboard, and
then to the branch terminal multiple switchboard, which latter was
the highest type of switchboard development at the time of the
advent of common-battery working.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 337. Series Magneto Multiple Switchboard</b><br />
<a href="images/fig337.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><b>Series-Multiple Board.</b> In Fig. 337 are shown the circuits of a
series magneto multiple switchboard as developed by the engineers
of the Western Electric Company during the eighties. As is usual,
two subscribers' lines and a single cord circuit are shown. One
side of each line passes directly from the subscriber's station to one
side of the drop, and also branches off to the sleeve contact of each
of the jacks. The other side of the line passes first to the tip spring
of the first jack, thence to the anvil of that jack and to the tip spring
of the next jack, and so on in series through all of the jacks belonging
in that line to the other terminal of the drop coil. Normally, therefore,
the drop is connected across the line ready to be responsive to
the signal sent from the subscriber's generator. The cord circuit is
of the two-conductor type, the plugs being provided with tip and
sleeve contacts, the tips being connected by one of the flexible conductors
through the proper ringing and listening key springs, and
the sleeve being likewise connected through the other flexible conductor
and the other springs of the ringing and listening keys. It is
obvious that when any plug is inserted into a jack, the circuit of the
line will be continued to the cord circuit and at the same time the
line drop will be cut out of the circuit, because of the lifting of the
tip spring of the jack from its anvil. Permanently connected between
the sleeve side of the cord circuit and ground is a retardation coil <i>1</i>
and a battery. Another retardation coil <i>2</i> is connected between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Page 55]</a></span>ground and a point on the operator's telephone circuit between the
operator's head receiver and the secondary of her induction coil.
These two retardation coils have to do with the busy test, the action
of which is as follows: normally, or when a line is not switched at
the central office, the test thimbles will all be at substantially ground
potential, <i>i. e.</i>, they are supposed to be. The point on the operator's
receiver circuit which is grounded through the retardation
coil <i>2</i> will also be of ground potential because of that connection to
ground. In order to test, the operator always has to throw her
listening key <i>L.K.</i> into the listening position. She also has to touch
the tip of the calling plug <i>P</i><sub>c</sub> to a sleeve or jack of the line that is being
tested. If, therefore, a test is made of an idle or non-busy line, the
touching of the tip of the calling plug with the test thimble of that
line will result in no flow of current through the operator's receiver,
because there will be no difference of potential anywhere in the test
circuit, which test circuit may be traced from the test thimble of the
line under test to the tip of the calling plug, thence through the tip
strand of the cord to the listening key, thence to the outer anvil of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Page 56]</a></span>the listening key on that side, through the operator's receiver to
ground through the impedance coil <i>2</i>. If, however, the line had
already been switched at some other section by the insertion of either
a calling or answering plug, all of the test thimbles of that line would
have been raised to a potential above that of the ground, by virtue
of the battery connected with the sleeve side of the cord circuit through
the retardation coil <i>1</i>. If the operator had made a test of such a line,
the tip of her testing plug would have found the thimble raised to the
potential of the battery and, therefore, a flow of current would occur
which would give her the busy click. The complete test circuit
thus formed in testing a busy line would be from the ungrounded
pole of the battery through the impedance coil <i>1</i> associated with the
cord that was already in connection with the line, thence to the
sleeve strand of that cord to the sleeve of the jack at which the line
was already switched, thence through that portion of the line circuit
to which all of the sleeve contacts were connected, and therefore
to the sleeve or test thimble of the jack at which the test is made,
thence through the tip of the calling plug employed in making the
test through the tip side of that cord circuit to the outer listening
key contact of the operator making the test, and thence to ground
through the operator's receiver and the impedance coil <i>2</i>. The
resultant click would be an indication to the operator that the line
was already in use and that, therefore, she must not make the connection.</p>

<p>The condenser <i>3</i> is associated with the operator's talking set
and with the extra spring in the listening key <i>L.K.</i> in such a manner
that when the listening key is thrown, the tip strand of the cord circuit
is divided and the condenser included between them. This is
for the purpose of preventing any potentials, which might exist on the
line with which the answering plug <i>P</i><sub>a</sub> was connected, from affecting
the busy-test conditions.</p>

<p><i>Operation.</i> The operation of the system aside from the busy-test
feature is just like that described in connection with the simple
magneto switchboard. Assuming that the subscriber at Station <i>A</i>
makes the call, he turns his hand generator, which throws the drop
on his line at the central office. The operator, seeing the signal,
inserts the answering plug of one of her idle pairs of cords into the
answering jack and throws her listening key <i>L.K.</i> This enables
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Page 57]</a></span>the operator to talk with the calling subscriber, and having found
that he desires a connection with the line extending to Station <i>B</i>,
she touches the tip of her calling plug to the multiple jack of that
line that is within her reach, it being remembered that each one of
the multiple jacks shown is on a different section. She leaves the
listening key in the listening position when she does this. If the line
is busy, the click will notify her that she must not make the connection,
in which case she informs the calling subscriber that the line is
busy and requests him to call again. If, however, she received no click,
she would insert the calling plug into the jack, thus completing the
connection between the two lines. She would then press the ringing
key associated with the calling plug and that momentarily disconnects
the calling plug from the answering plug and at the same
time establishes connection between the ringing generator and the
called line. The release of the ringing key again connects the calling
and answering plugs and, therefore, connects the two subscribers'
lines ready for conversation. All that is then necessary is that the
called subscriber shall respond and remove his receiver from its
hook, the calling subscriber already having done this. When the
conversation is finished, both of the subscribers (if they remember it)
will operate their ringing generators, which will throw the clearing-out
drop as a signal to the operator for disconnection. If it should
become necessary for the operator to ring back on the line of the
calling subscriber, she may do so by pressing the ringing key associated
with the calling plug.</p>

<p>Frequently this multiple switchboard arrangement was used
with grounded lines, in which case the single line wire extending
from the subscriber's station to the switchboard was connected
with the tip spring of the first jack, the circuit being continued in
series through the jack to the drop and thence to ground through
a high non-inductive resistance.</p>

<p><i>Defects.</i> This series multiple magneto system was used with
a great many variations, and it had a good many defects. One of
these defects was due to the necessary extending of one limb of the
line through a large number of series contacts in the jacks. This
is not to be desired in any case, but it was particularly objectionable
in the early days before jacks had been developed to their present
high state of perfection. A particle of dust or other insulating
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Page 58]</a></span>matter, lodging between the tip spring and its anvil in any one of the
jacks, would leave the line open, thus disabling the line to incoming
signals, and also for conversation in case the break happened to
occur between the subscriber and the jack that was used in connecting
with the line. Another defect due to the same cause was
that the line through the switchboard was always unbalanced by
the insertion of a plug, one limb of the line always extending clear
through the switchboard to the drop and the other, when the plug
was inserted, extending only part way through the switchboard and
being cut off at the jack where the connection was made. The objection
will be apparent when it is remembered that the wires in the
line circuit connecting the multiple jacks are necessarily very closely
bunched together and, therefore, there is very likely to be cross-talk
between two adjacent lines unless the two limbs of each line are
exactly balanced throughout their entire length.</p>

<p>Again the busy-test conditions of this circuit were not ideal.
The fact that the test rings of the line were connected permanently
with the outside line circuit subjected these test rings to whatever
potentials might exist on the outside lines, due to any causes whatever,
such as a cross with some other wire; thus the test rings of an
idle line might by some exterior cause be raised to such a potential
that the line would test busy. It may be laid down as a fundamental
principle in good multiple switchboard practice that the busy-test
condition should be made independent of any conditions on the line
circuit outside of the central office, and such is not the case in this
circuit just described.</p>


<p><b>Branch-Terminal Multiple Board.</b> The next important step
in the development of the magneto multiple switchboard was that
which produced the so-called branch-terminal board. This came
into wide use in the various Bell operating companies before the
advent of the common-battery systems. Its circuits and the principles
of operation may be understood in connection with Fig. 338.
In the branch-terminal system there are no series contacts in the
jacks and no unbalancing of the line due to a cutting off of a portion
of the line circuit when a connection was made with it. Furthermore,
the test circuits were entirely local to the central office and
were not likely to be affected by outside conditions on the line.
This switchboard also added the feature of the automatic restoration
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Page 59]</a></span>of the drops, thus relieving the operator of the burden of doing
that manually, and also permitting the drops to be mounted on a
portion of the switchboard that was not available for the mounting
of jacks, and thus permitting a greater capacity in jack equipment.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig338_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 338. Branch-Terminal Magneto Multiple Switchboard</b><br />
<a href="images/fig338.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Each jack has five contacts, and the answering and multiple
jacks are alike, both in respect to their construction and their connection
with the line. The drops are the electrically self-restoring
type shown in Fig. 263. The line circuits extended permanently
from the subscriber's station to the line winding of the drop and the
two limbs of the line branched off to the tip and sleeve contacts <i>1</i>
and <i>2</i> respectively of each jack. Another pair of wires extended
through the multiple parallel to the line wires and these branched off
respectively to the contact springs <i>3</i> and <i>4</i> of each of the jacks.
This pair of wires formed portions of the drop-restoring circuit,
including the restoring coil <i>6</i> and the battery <i>7</i>, as indicated. The
test thimble <i>5</i> of each of the jacks is connected permanently with the
spring <i>3</i> of the corresponding jack and, therefore, with the wire
which connects through the restoring coil <i>6</i> of the corresponding
drop to ground through the battery <i>7</i>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Page 60]</a></span></p><p>The plugs were each provided with three contacts. Two of
these were the usual tip and sleeve contacts connected with the
two strands of the cord circuit. The third contact <i>8</i> was not connected
with any portion of the cord circuit, being merely an insulated
contact on the plug adapted, when the plug was fully inserted, to
connect together the springs <i>3</i> and <i>4</i>. The cord circuit itself is readily
understood from the drawing, having two features, however, which
merit attention. One is the establishing of a grounded battery
connection to the center portion of the winding of the receiver for
the purposes of the busy test, and the other is the provision of a restoring
coil and restoring circuit for the clearing-out drop, this circuit
being closed by an additional contact on the listening key so as
to restore the clearing-out drop whenever the listening key was operated.</p>

<p><i>Operation.</i> An understanding of the operation of this system
is easy. The turning of the subscriber's generator, when the line
was in its normal condition, caused the display of the line signal.
The insertion of the answering plug, in response to this call, did
three things: (1) It extended the line circuit to the tip and sleeve
strand of the cord circuit. (2) It energized the restoring coil <i>6</i>
of the drop by establishing the circuit from the contact spring <i>3</i>
through the plug contact <i>8</i> to the other contact spring <i>4</i>, thus completing
the circuit between the two normally open auxiliary wires.
(3) The connecting of the springs <i>3</i> and <i>4</i> established a connection
from ground to the test thimbles of all the jacks on a line, the spring
<i>4</i> being always grounded and the spring <i>3</i> being always connected
to the test thimble <i>5</i>.</p>

<p>It is to be noted that on idle lines the test rings are always at
the same potential as the ungrounded pole of the battery <i>7</i>, being
connected thereto through the winding <i>6</i> of the restoring coil. On
all busy lines, however, the test rings are dead grounded through the
contact <i>8</i> of the plug that is connected with the line.</p>

<p>The tip of the testing plug at the time of making a test will also
be at the same potential as that of the ungrounded pole of the battery
<i>7</i>, since this pole of the battery <i>7</i> is always connected to the center
portion of the operator's receiver winding, and when the listening
key is thrown the tip of the calling plug is connected therewith
and is at the same potential. When, therefore, the operator touches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Page 61]</a></span>the tip of the calling plug to the test thimble of an idle line, she will
get no click, since the tip of the plug and the test thimble will be at
the same potential. If, however, the line has already been switched
at another section of the board, there will be a difference of potential,
because the test thimble will be grounded, and the circuit, through
which the current which causes the click flows, may be traced from
the ungrounded pole of the battery <i>7</i> to the center portion of the
operator's receiver, thence through one-half of the winding to the
tip of the calling plug, thence to the test thimble of the jack under
test, thence to the spring <i>3</i> of the jack on another section at which the
connection exists, through the contact <i>8</i> on the plug of that jack to
the spring <i>4</i>, and thence to ground and back to the other terminal of
the battery <i>7</i>.</p>

<p><i>Magnet Windings.</i> Coils of the line and clearing-out drops
by which these drops are thrown, are wound to such high resistance
and impedance as to make it proper to leave them permanently
bridged across the talking circuit. The necessity for cutting them
out is, therefore, done away with, with a consequent avoidance, in
the case of the line drops, of the provision of series contacts in the
jacks.</p>

<p><i>Arrangement of Apparatus.</i> In boards of this type the line
and clearing-out drops were mounted in the extreme upper portion
of the switchboard face so as to be within the range of vision of the
operator, but yet out of her reach. Therefore, the whole face of the
board that was within the limit of the operator's reach was available
for the answering and multiple jacks. A front view of a little over
one of the sections of the switchboard, involving three complete
operator's positions, is shown in Fig. 339, which is a portion of the
switchboard installed by the Western Electric Company in one of
the large exchanges in Paris, France. (This has recently been
replaced by a common-battery multiple board.) In this the line
drops may be seen at the extreme top of the face of the switchboard,
and immediately beneath these the clearing-out drops. Beneath
these are the multiple jacks arranged in banks of one hundred, each
hundred consisting of five strips of twenty. At the extreme lower
portion of the jack space are shown the answering jacks and beneath
these on the horizontal shelf, the plugs and keys. These jacks
were mounted on <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>-inch centers, both vertically and horizontally
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Page 62]</a></span>and each section had in multiple 90 banks of 100 each, making 9,000
in all. Subsequent practice has shown that this involves too large
a reach for the operators and that, therefore, 9,000 is too large a number
of jacks to place on one section if the jacks are not spaced closer
than on <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>-inch centers. With the jack involving as many parts as
that required by this branch terminal system, it was hardly feasible
to make them smaller than this without sacrificing their durability,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Page 63]</a></span>and one of the important features of the common-battery multiple
system which has supplanted this branch-terminal magneto system
is that the jacks are of such a simple nature as to lend themselves to
mounting on <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch centers, and in some cases on <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span>-inch centers.</p>

<p><b>Modern Magneto Multiple Board.</b> Coming now to a consideration
of modern magneto multiple switchboards, and bearing in mind
that such boards are to be found in modern practice only in comparatively
small installations and then only under rather peculiar conditions,
as already set forth, we will consider the switchboard of the
Monarch Telephone Manufacturing Company as typical of good
practice in this respect.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 340. Monarch Magneto Multiple Switchboard Circuits</b><br />
<a href="images/fig340.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>Line Circuit.</i> The line and cord circuits of the Monarch system
are shown in Fig. 340. It will be seen that each jack has in
all five contacts, numbered from <i>1</i> to <i>5</i> respectively, of which <i>1</i> and
<i>4</i> are the springs which register with the tip and ring contacts of the
plug and through which the talking circuit is continued, while <i>2</i> and
<i>3</i> are series contacts for cutting off the line drop when a plug is inserted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Page 64]</a></span>and <i>5</i> is the test contact or thimble adapted to register with the sleeve
contact on the plug when the plug is fully inserted. The line circuit
through the drop may be traced normally from one side of the
line through the drop coil, thence through all of the pairs of springs
<i>2</i> and <i>3</i> in the jacks of that line, and thence to spring <i>1</i> of the last jack,
this spring always being strapped to the spring <i>2</i> in the last jack, and
thence to the other side of the line. All the ring springs <i>1</i> are permanently
tapped on to one side of the line, and all of the tip springs
<i>4</i> are permanently tapped to the other side of the line. This system
may, therefore, properly be called a branch-terminal system. It
is seen that as soon as a plug is inserted into any of the jacks, the
circuit through the drop will be broken by the opening of the springs
<i>2</i> and <i>3</i> in that jack. The drop shown immediately above the
answering jack is so associated mechanically with that jack as to be
mechanically self-restored when the answering plug is inserted into the
answering jack in response to a call. The arrangement in this respect
is the same as that shown in Fig. 259, illustrating the Monarch
combined drop and jack.</p>

<p><i>Cord Circuit.</i> The cord circuit needs little explanation. The
tip and ring strands are the ones which carry the talking current
and across these is bridged the double-wound clearing-out drop, a
condenser being included in series in the tip strand between the
two drop windings in the manner already explained in connection
with Fig. 284. The third or sleeve strand of the cord is continuous
from plug to plug, and between it and the ground there is permanently
connected a retardation coil.</p>

<p><i>Test.</i> The test is dependent on the presence or absence of
a path to ground from the test thimbles through some retardation
coil associated with a cord circuit. Obviously, in the case of an
idle line there will be no path to ground from the test thimbles, since
normally they are merely connected to each other and are insulated
from everything else. When, however, a plug is inserted into a
multiple or answering jack, the test thimbles of that line are connected
to ground through the retardation coil associated with the third
strand of the plug used in making the connection. When the operator
applies the tip of the calling plug to a test contact of a multiple
jack there will be no path to ground afforded if the line is idle, while
if it is busy the potential of the tip of the test plug will cause a current
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Page 65]</a></span>to flow to ground through the impedance coil associated with
the plug used in making the connection. This will be made clearer
by tracing the test circuit. With the listening key thrown this may
be traced from the live side of the battery through the retardation
coil <i>6</i>, which is common to an operator's position, thence through
the tip side of the listening key to the tip conductor of the calling cord,
and thence to the tip of the calling plug and the thimble of the jack
under test. If the line is idle there will be no path to ground from
this point and no click will result, but if the line is busy, current will
flow from the tip of the test plug to the thimble of the jack tested,
thence by the test wire in the multiple to the thimble of the jack at
which a connection already exists, and thence to ground through the
third strand of the cord used in making that connection and the
impedance coil associated therewith. The current which flows in
this test circuit changes momentarily the potential of the tip side
of the operator's telephone circuit, thus unbalancing her talking
circuit and causing a click.</p>

<p>If this test system were used in a very large board where the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Page 66]</a></span>multiple would extend through a great many sections, there would be
some liability of a false test due to the static capacity of the test
contacts and the test wire running through the multiple. For small
boards, however, where the multiple is short, this system has proven
reliable. A multiple magneto switchboard employing the form of
circuits just described is shown in Fig. 341. This switchboard consists
of three sections of two positions each. The combined answering
jacks and drops may be seen at the lower part of the face of the
switchboard and occupying somewhat over one-half of the jack and
drop space. The multiple jacks are above the answering jacks and
drops and it may be noted that the same arrangement and number
of these jacks is repeated in each section. This switchboard may
be extended by adding more sections and increasing the multiple in
those already installed to serve 1,600 lines.</p>

<p><i>Assembly.</i> In connection with the assembly of these magneto
multiple switchboards, as installed by the Monarch Company, Fig.
342 shows the details of the cord rack at
the back of the board. It shows how the
ends of the switchboard cords opposite to
the ends that are fastened to the plugs are
connected permanently to terminals on the
cord rack, at which point the flexible conductors
are brought out to terminal clips or
binding posts, to which the wires leading
from the other portions of the cord circuit
are led. In order to relieve the conductors
in the cords from strain, the outer braiding
of the cord at the rack end is usually extended
to form what is called a <i>strain cord</i>,
and this attached to an eyelet under the
cord rack, so that the weight of the cord and the cord weights will
be borne by the braiding rather than by the conductors. This
leaves the insulated conductors extending from the ends of the
cords free to hang loose without strain and be connected to the
terminals as shown. This method of connecting cords, with variations
in form and detail, is practically universal in all types of
switchboards.</p>

<p>A detail of the assembly of the drops and jacks in such a switchboard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Page 67]</a></span>is shown in Fig. 343. The single pair of clearing-out drops
is mounted in the lower part of the vertical face of the switchboard
just above the space occupied by the plug shelf. Vertical stile strips
extend above the clearing-out drop space for supporting the drops
and jacks. A single row of 10 answering jacks and the corresponding
line drops are shown in place. Above these there would be
placed, in the completely assembled board, the other answering jacks
and line signals that were to occupy this panel, and above these the
strips of multiple jacks. The rearwardly projecting pins from the
stile strips are for the support of the multiple jack strips, these pins
supporting the strips horizontally by suitable multiple clips at the
ends of the jack strips; the jack strips being fastened from the rear
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Page 68]</a></span>by means of nuts engaging the screw threads on these pins. This
method of supporting drops and jacks is one that is equally adaptable
for use in other forms of boards, such as the simple magneto
switchboard.</p>

<p>In Fig. 344 is shown a detail photograph of the key shelf wiring
in one of these Monarch magneto switchboards. In this the
under side of the keys is shown, the key shelf being raised on its hinge
for that purpose. The cable, containing all of the insulated wires
leading to these keys, enters the space under the key shelf at the
extreme left and from the rear. It then passes to the right of this
space where a "knee" is formed, after which the cable is securely
strapped to the under side of the key shelf. By this construction
sufficient flexibility is provided for in the cable to permit the raising
and lowering of the key shelf, the long reach of the cable between the
"knee" and the point of entry at the left serving as a torsion member,
so that the raising of the shelf will give the cable a slight twist rather
than bend it at a sharp angle.</p>

<span style="font-size:80%;">THE COMMON-BATTERY MULTIPLE SWITCHBOARD</span></h2>


<p><b>Western Electric No. 1 Relay Board.</b> The common-battery
multiple switchboard differs from the simple or non-multiple common-battery
switchboard mainly in the provision of multiple jacks
and in the added features which are involved in the provision for a
busy test. The principles of signaling and of supplying current
to the subscribers for talking are the same as in the non-multiple
common-battery board. For purposes of illustrating the practical
workings of the common-battery multiple switchboard, we will
take the standard form of the Western Electric Company, choosing
this only because it is the standard with nearly all the Bell operating
companies throughout the United States.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig345_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 345. Line Circuit Western Electric No. 1. Board</b><br />
<a href="images/fig345.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>Line Circuit.</i> We will first consider the line circuit in simplified
form, as shown in Fig. 345. At the left in this figure the common-battery
circuit is shown at the subscriber's station, and at the
right the central-office apparatus is indicated so far as equipment
of a single line is concerned. In this simplified diagram no attempt
has been made to show the relative positions of the various parts,
these having been grouped in this figure in such a way as to give as
clear and simple an idea as possible of the circuit arrangements.
It is seen at a glance that this is a branch terminal board, the three
contacts of each jack being connected by separate taps or legs to
three wires running throughout the length of the board, these three
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Page 70]</a></span>wires being individual to the jacks of one line. On this account
this line circuit is commonly referred to as a three-wire circuit. By
the same considerations it will be seen that the switchboard line
circuit of the branch-terminal multiple magneto system, shown in
Fig. 338, would be called a four-wire circuit. It will be shown
later that other multiple switchboards in wide use have a still further
reduction in the number of wires running through the jacks, or
through the multiple as it is called, such being referred to as two-wire
switchboards.</p>

<p>The two limbs of the line which extend from the subscriber's
circuit, beside being connected by taps to the tip and sleeve contacts
of the jack respectively, connect with the two back contacts of a
cut-off relay, and when this relay is in its normal or unenergized
condition, these two limbs of the line are continued through the windings
of the line relay and thence one to the ungrounded or negative
side of the common-battery and the other to the grounded side.
The subscriber's station circuit being normally open, no current
flows through the line, but when the subscriber removes his receiver
for the purpose of making a call the line circuit is completed and
current flows through the coil of the line relay, thus energizing that
relay and causing it to complete the circuit of the line lamp. The
cut-off relay plays no part in the operation of the subscriber's calling,
but merely leaves the circuit of the line connected through to the
calling relay and battery. The coil of the cut-off relay is connected
to ground on one side and on the other side to the third wire running
through the switchboard multiple and which is tapped off to
each of the test rings on the jacks. As will be shown later, when
the operator plugs into the jack of a line, such a connection is established
that the test ring of that jack will be connected to the live or
negative pole of the common battery, which will cause current to
flow through the coil of the cut-off relay, which will then operate to
<i>cut off</i> both of the limbs of the line from their normal connection
with ground and the battery and the line relay. Hence the name
<i>cut-off relay</i>.</p>

<p>The use of the cut-off relay to sever the calling apparatus from
the line at all times when the line is switched serves to make possible
a very much simpler jack than would otherwise be required, as will
be obvious to anyone who tries to design a common-battery multiple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Page 71]</a></span>system without a cut-off relay. The additional complication
introduced by the cut-off relay is more than offset by the saving in
complexity of the jacks. It is desirable, on account of the great
number of jacks necessarily employed in a multiple switchboard, that
the jacks be of the simplest possible construction, thus reducing
to a minimum their first cost and making them much less likely
to get out of order.</p>

<p><i>Cord Circuit.</i> The cord circuit of the Western Electric standard
multiple common-battery switchboard is shown in Fig. 346. This
cord circuit involves the use of three strands in the flexible cords
of both the calling and the answering plugs. Two of these are the
ordinary tip and ring conductors over which speech is transmitted
to the connected subscriber's wire. The third, the sleeve strand, carries
the supervisory lamps and has associated with it other apparatus
for the control of these lamps and of the test circuit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig346_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 346. Cord Circuit Western Electric No. 1 Board</b><br />
<a href="images/fig346.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The system of battery feed is the well-known split repeating-coil
arrangement already discussed. The tip strand runs straight
through to the repeating coil, while the ring strand contains, in each
case, the winding of the supervisory relay corresponding to either
the calling or the answering plug. In order that the presence in the
talking circuit of a magnet winding possessing considerable impedance
may not interfere with the talking efficiency, each of these
supervisory relay windings is shunted by a non-inductive resistance.
In practice the supervisory relay windings have each a resistance
of about 20 ohms and the shunt around them each a resistance of
about 31 ohms. In the third strand of each cord is placed a 12-volt
supervisory lamp, and in series with it a resistance of about 80
ohms. Each supervisory relay is adapted, when energized, to close
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Page 72]</a></span>a 40-ohm shunt about its supervisory lamp. The arrangement and
proportion of these resistances is such that when a plug is inserted
into the jack of a line the lamp will receive current from a circuit
traced from the negative pole of the battery in the center of the cord
circuit through the lamp and the 80-ohm series resistance, through
the third strand of the cord to the test thimble of the jack, and thence
to the positive or grounded pole of the battery through the third
conductor in the multiple and the winding of the cut-off relay. This
current always flows as long as the plug is inserted, and it is just
sufficient to illuminate the lamp when the supervisory relay armature
is not attracted. When, however, the supervisory relay armature
is attracted, the shunting of the lamp by the 40-ohm resistance
cuts down the current to such a degree as to prevent the illumination
of the lamp, although some current still flows through it.</p>

<p>The usual ringing and listening key is associated with the calling
plug, and in some cases a ring-back key is associated with the
answering plug, but this is not standard practice.</p>

<p><i>Operation.</i> The operation of this cord circuit in conjunction
with the line circuit of Fig. 345 may best be understood by reference
to Fig. 347. This figure employs a little different arrangement of
the line circuit in order more clearly to indicate how the two lines
may be connected by a cord; a study of the two line circuits, however,
will show that they are identical in actual connections. It is
to be remembered that all of the battery symbols shown in this
figure represent in reality the same battery, separate symbols being
shown for greater simplicity in circuit connections.</p>

<p>We will assume the subscriber at Station <i>A</i> calls for the subscriber
at Station <i>B</i>. The operation of the line relay and the consequent
lighting of the line lamp, and also the operation of the pilot
relay will be obvious from what has been stated. The response of
the operator by inserting the answering plug into the answering jack,
and the throwing of her listening key so as to bridge her talking circuit
across the cord in order to place herself in communication with
the subscriber, is also obvious. The insertion of the answering
plug into the answering jack completed the circuit through the third
strand of the cord and the winding of the cut-off relay of the calling
line, and this accomplishes three desirable results. The circuit so
completed may be traced from the negative or ungrounded side of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Page 73]</a></span>the battery to the center portion of the cord circuit, thence through
the supervisory lamp <i>1</i>, resistance <i>2</i>, to the third conductor on the
plug, test thimble on the jack, thence through the winding of the
cut-off relay to ground, which forms the other terminal of the battery.
The results accomplished by the closing of this circuit are:
first, the energizing of the cut-off relay to cut off the signaling portion
of the line; second, the flowing of current through the lamp that
is almost sufficient to illuminate it, but not quite so because of the
closure of the shunt about it, for the reason that will be described;
third, the raising of the potential of all the contact thimbles on the
jacks from zero to a potential different from that of the ground and
equal in amount to the fall of potential through the winding of the
cut-off relay. A condition is thus established at the test rings such
that some other operator at some other section in testing the line
will find it busy and will not connect with it.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig347_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 347. Western Electric No. 1 Board</b><br />
<a href="images/fig347.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The reason why the lamp <i>1</i>, connected with the answering plug,
was not lighted was that the supervisory relay <i>3</i>, associated with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Page 74]</a></span>answering plug, became energized when the operator plugged in,
due to the flow of current from the battery through the calling subscriber's
talking apparatus, this flow of current being permitted by
the removal of the calling subscriber's receiver from its hook. The
energizing of this relay magnet by causing the attraction of its armature,
closed the shunt about the lamp <i>1</i>, which shunt contains the
40-ohm resistance <i>4</i>, and thus prevents the lamp from receiving enough
current to illuminate it. Obviously, as soon as the calling subscriber
replaces his receiver on its hook, the supervisory relay <i>3</i> will
be de-energized, the shunt around the lamp will be broken, and the
lamp will be illuminated to indicate to the operator the fact that the
subscriber with whose line her calling plug is connected has replaced
his receiver on its hook.</p>

<p><i>Testing&mdash;Called Line Idle.</i> Having now shown how the operator
connects with the calling subscriber's line and how that line
automatically becomes guarded as soon as it is connected with, so
that no other operator will connect with it, we will discuss how the
operator tests the called line and subsequently connects with that
line, if it is found proper to do so. If, on making the test with one
of the multiple jacks of the line leading to Station <i>B</i>, that line is idle
and free to be connected with, its test rings will all be at zero potential
because of the fact that they are connected with ground through
the cut-off relay winding with no source of current connected with
them. The tip of the calling plug will also be at zero potential in
making this test, because it is connected to ground through the tip
side of the calling-plug circuit and one winding of the cord-circuit
repeating coil. As a result no flow of current will occur, the operator
will receive no click, and she will know that she is free to connect with
the line. As soon as she does so, by inserting the plug, the third
strand of the cord will be connected with the test thimble of the calling
line and the resulting flow of current will bring about three results,
two of which are the same, and one of which is slightly different from
those described as resulting from the insertion of the answering
plug into the jack of the calling line. First, the cut-off relay will be
operated and cut off the line signaling apparatus from the called
line; second, a flow of current will result through the calling supervisory
lamp <i>5</i>, which in this case will be sufficient to illuminate that
lamp for the reason that the called subscriber has not yet responded,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Page 75]</a></span>the calling supervisory relay <i>6</i> has, therefore, not yet been energized,
and the lamp has not, therefore, been shunted by its associated resistance
<i>7</i>; third, the test thimbles of the called line will be raised to a
potential above that of the earth, and thus the line will be guarded
against connection at another section of the switchboard. As soon
as the called subscriber responds to the ringing current sent out
by the operator, current will flow over the cord circuit and over his
line through his transmitter. This will cause the calling supervisory
relay to be energized and the calling lamp to be extinguished. Both
lamps <i>1</i> and <i>5</i> remain extinguished as long as the connected subscribers
are in conversation, but as soon as either one of them hangs up
his receiver the corresponding lamp will be lighted, due to the de-energization
of the supervisory relay and the breaking of the shunt
around the lamp. The lighting of both lamps associated with a
cord circuit is a signal to the operator for disconnection.</p>


<p><i>Testing&mdash;Called Line Busy.</i> If we now assume that the called
line was already busy, by virtue of being connected with at another
section, the test rings of that line would accordingly all be raised
to a potential above that of the earth. As a result, when the operator
applied the tip of her calling plug to a test thimble on that line,
current would flow from this test thimble through the tip of the
calling plug and tip strand of the cord and through one winding
of the cord-circuit repeating coil to ground. This would cause a
slight raising of potential of the entire tip side of the cord circuit and
a consequent momentary flow of current through the secondary of
the operator's circuit bridged across the cord circuit at that time.</p>

<p><i>Operator's Circuit Details.</i> The details of the operator's talking
circuit shown in Fig. 347 deserve some attention. The battery
supply to the operator's transmitter is through an impedance coil <i>9</i>.
The condenser <i>12</i> is bridged around the transmitter and the two
primary windings <i>10</i> and <i>11</i>, which windings are in parallel so as to
afford a local circuit for the passage of fluctuating currents set up by
the transmitter. The two primary windings <i>10</i> and <i>11</i> are on separate
induction coils, the secondary windings <i>13</i> and <i>14</i> being, therefore,
on separate cores. The winding <i>15</i>, in circuit with the secondary
winding <i>14</i> and the receiver, is a non-inductive winding and is
supposed to have a resistance about equal to the effective resistance
to fluctuating currents of a subscriber's line of average length. Owing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Page 76]</a></span>to the respective directions of the primary and secondary windings
<i>10</i> and <i>11</i>, <i>13</i> and <i>14</i>, the result is that the outgoing currents set up
by the operator's transmitter are largely neutralized in the operator's
receiver. Incoming currents from either of the connected subscribers,
however, pass, in the main, through the secondary coil <i>13</i>
and the operator's receiver, rather than through the shunt path
formed by the secondary <i>14</i>, and the non-inductive resistance <i>15</i>.
This is known as an "anti-side tone" arrangement, and its object is
to prevent the operator from receiving her own voice transmission
so loudly as to make her ear insensitive to the feebler voice currents
coming in from the subscribers.</p>

<p><i>Order-Wire Circuits.</i> The two keys <i>16</i> and <i>17</i>, shown in
connection with the operator's talking circuit in Fig. 347, play no part
in the regular operation of connecting two local lines, as described
above. They are order-wire keys, and the circuits with which they
connect lead to the telephone sets of other operators at distant central
offices, and by pressing either one of these keys the operator is enabled
to place herself in communication over these so-called order-wire
circuits with such other operators. The function and mode
of operation of these order-wire circuits will be described in the next
chapter, wherein inter-office connections will be discussed.</p>

<p><i>Wiring of Line Circuit.</i> The line circuits shown in Figs. 345
and 347 are, as stated, simplified to facilitate understanding, although
the connections shown are those which actually exist. The more
complete wiring of a single line circuit is shown in Fig. 348. The
line wires are shown entering at the left. They pass immediately,
upon entering the central office, through the main distributing frame,
the functions and construction of which will be considered in detail
in a subsequent chapter. The dotted portions of the circuit shown
in connection with this main distributing frame indicate the path
from the terminals on one side of the frame to those on the other
through so-called jumper wires. The two limbs of the line then
pass to terminals <i>1</i> and <i>2</i> on one side of the so-called intermediate
distributing frame. Here the circuit of each limb of the line divides,
passing, on the one hand, to the tip and sleeve springs of all the multiple
jacks belonging to that line; and, on the other hand, through
the jumper wires indicated by dotted lines on the intermediate distributing
frame, and thence to the tip and ring contacts of the answering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Page 77]</a></span>jack. A consideration of this connection will show that
the actual electrical connections so far as already described are
exactly those of Figs. 345 and 347, although those figures omitted the
main and intermediate distributing frames. Only two limbs of the
line are involved in the main frame. In the intermediate frame
the test wire running through the multiple is also involved. This
test wire, it will be seen, leads from the test thimbles of all the
multiple jacks to the terminal <i>3</i> on the intermediate frame, thence
through the jumper wire to the terminal <i>6</i> of this frame, and to
the test thimble of the answering jack. Here again the electrical
connections are exactly those represented in Figs. 345 and 347, although
those figures do not show the intermediate frame.</p>

<p>The two terminals <i>4</i> and <i>5</i> of the intermediate frame, besides
being connected to the tip and sleeve springs of the answering jack,
are connected to the contacts of the cut-off relay, and thence through
the coils of the line relay to ground on one side and to battery on
the other. Thus the line relay and battery are normally included in
the circuit of the line. The contact <i>6</i> on the intermediate distributing
frame, besides being connected to the test thimble of all the
jacks, is connected through the coil of the cut-off relay to ground,
thus establishing a path by which current is supplied to the cut-off
relay when connection is made to the line at any jack. There is
another contact <i>7</i> on the intermediate distributing frame which
merely forms a terminal for joining one side of the line lamp to the
back contact of the line relay.</p>

<p><i>Functions of Distributing Frames.</i> Since the line circuit thus
far described in connection with Fig. 348 is exactly the same as that
of Fig. 345 in its electrical connections, it becomes obvious that the
main and intermediate distributing frames play no part in the operation
of the circuit any more than a binding post of a telephone
plays a part in its operation. These frames carry terminals for
facilitating the connection of the various wires in the line circuit and,
as will be shown later, for facilitating certain changes in the line
connection.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 348. Line Circuit No. 1 Board</b><br />
<a href="images/fig348.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Remembering that the dotted lines in Fig. 348 indicate jumper
wires of the main and intermediate distributing frames, and that
these are in the nature of temporary or readily changeable connections,
and that the full lines, whether heavy or light, are permanent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Page 78]</a></span>connections not readily changeable, it will be seen that the wires
leading through the multiple jacks of a certain line are permanently
associated with each other, and with certain terminals on the main
distributing frame and certain other terminals on the intermediate
distributing frame. It will also be seen that the line lamp and the
answering jack, together with the cut-off relay and line relay, are
permanently associated with each other and with another group of
terminals <i>4</i>, <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>, and <i>7</i> on the intermediate distributing frame. It
will also be apparent that by changing the jumper wires on the main
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Page 79]</a></span>frame, any outside line may be connected with any different set of
line switchboard equipment, and also that by making changes in the
jumper wires on the intermediate frame, any given answering jack
and line lamp with its associated line cut-off relay may be associated
with any set of multiple jacks.</p>

<p><i>Pilot Signals.</i> In a portion of the circuit leading from the
battery that is common to a group of line lamps is the winding of
the pilot relay, which is common to this group of line lamps. This
controls, as already described, the circuit of the pilot lamp common
to the same group of line lamps. In addition, a night-bell circuit
is sometimes provided, this usually being in the form of an ordinary
polarized ringer, the circuit of which is controlled by a night-bell
relay common to the entire office. Normally, this relay is shunted
out of the circuit of the common portion of the lead to the pilot
relay contacts by the key <i>8</i>, but when the key <i>8</i> is opened all current
that is fed to the pilot lamps passes through the night-bell relay,
and thus, whenever any pilot lamp is lighted, the night-bell relay will
attract its armature and thus close the circuit of the calling generator
through the night bell.</p>

<p>A study of this figure will make clear to the student how the
portions of the circuit that are individual to the line are associated
with such things as the battery, that are common to the entire office,
and such as the pilot relay and lamp, that are common to a group of
lines terminating in one position.</p>

<p><i>Modified Relay Windings.</i> In some cases, the line relay instead
of being double wound, as shown, is made with a single winding,
this winding being normally included between the ring side of the
cut-off relay and the battery, the tip side of the cut-off relay being
run direct to ground. The present practice of the Western Electric
Company is towards the double-wound relay, however, and that is
considered standard in all of their large No. 1 multiple boards, except
where the customer, owing to special reasons, demands a single
wound relay on the ring side of the line. The prime reason for the
two-winding line relay is the lessened click in the calling-subscriber's
receiver which occurs when the operator answers. All line relays
prior to 1902 were single-wound, but after that they were made
double and used some turns of resistance wire to limit the normal
calling current.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Page 80]</a></span></p><p><i>Relay Mounting.</i> In the standard No. 1 relay board of the
Western Electric Company and, in fact, in nearly all common-battery
multiple boards that are manufactured by other companies,
the line and cut-off relays are mounted on separate racks outside
the switchboard room and adjacent to the main and intermediate
distributing frames, the wiring being extended from the relays to
the jacks and lamps on the switchboard proper by means of suitable
cables. The Western Electric Company has recently instituted a
departure from this practice in the case of some of their smaller No.
1 switchboard installations. Where it is thought that the ultimate
capacity required by the board will not be above 3,000 lines, the
relay rack is dispensed with and all of the line and cut-off relays,
as well as the supervisory relays, are mounted in the rear of the
switchboard frame. For this purpose the line and cut-off relays
are specially made with the view to securing the utmost compactness.
In still other cases, in switchboards of relatively small ultimate
capacity, they use this small line and cut-off relay mounted on a separate
relay rack, in which case the board is the standard No. 1 board
except for the type of relays. In all of these modifications of the
No. 1 board adapted for the use of the smaller and cheaper relays, the
line relay has but a single winding, the small size of the relay winding
not lending itself readily to double winding with the added necessary
coil terminals.</p>

<p><i>Capacity Range.</i> The No. 1 Western Electric board is made
in standard sizes up to an ultimate capacity of 9,600 lines. For all
capacities above 4,900 lines, a <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch jack, vertical and horizontal
face dimensions, is employed. For this capacity the smaller types
of cut-off and line relays are not employed. Up to ultimate capacities
of 4,900 lines, <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>-inch jacks are employed, and either the small
or the large relays mounted on a separate rack are available. Up
to 3,000 lines ultimate capacity, the <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>-inch jack is employed, and
either the small or the large cut-off and line relays are available,
but in case the small type is used the purchaser has the option of
mounting them on a separate relay rack, as in ordinary practice, or
mounting them in the switchboard cabinet and dispensing with the
relay rack.</p>

<p><b>Western Electric No. 10 Board.</b> The No. 1 common-battery
multiple switchboard, regardless of its size and type of arrangement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Page 81]</a></span>of line and cut-off relays, involves two relays for each line, the line
relay energized by the taking of the receiver off its hook, and the cut-off
relay energized by the act of the operator on plugging in and serving
to remove the line relay from the circuit whenever and as long as
a plug is inserted into any jack of the line. This seems to involve a
considerable expense in relays, but this, as has been stated, is warranted
by the greater simplicity in jacks which the use of the cut-off
relay makes possible. In addition to this expense of investment in
the line and cut-off relays, the amount of current required to hold up
the cut-off relays during conversations foots up to a considerable item
of expense, particularly as the system of supervisory signals is one in
which the supervisory lamp takes current not only while burning,
but its circuit takes even more current when the lamp is extinguished
during the time of a connection. For all of these reasons, and some
other minor ones, it was deemed expedient by the engineers of the
Western Electric Company to design a common-battery multiple
switchboard for small and medium-sized exchanges in which certain
sacrifices might be made to the end of accomplishing certain savings.
The result has been a type of switchboard, designated the No. 10,
which may be found in a number of Bell exchanges, it being considered
particularly adaptable to installations of from 500 to 3,000
lines. Although this board has been subject to a good deal of adverse
criticism, and although it seems probable that even for the
cheaper boards the No. 1 type with some of the modifications just
described will eventually supersede this No. 10 board, yet the present
extent of use of the No. 10 board and the instructive features which
its type displays warrant its discussion here.</p>

<p><i>Circuits.</i> The circuits of this switchboard are shown in Fig.
349, this indicating two-line circuits and a connecting cord circuit,
together with the auxiliary apparatus employed in connection with
the operator's telephone circuit, the pilot and night alarm circuits.
The most noticeable feature is that cut-off jacks are employed, the
circuit of the line normally extending through the sets of jack springs
in the multiple, and answering jacks to the line relay and battery on
one side of the line, and to ground on the other side. Obviously,
the additional complexity of the jack saves the use of a cut-off relay
and the relay equipment of each line consists, therefore, of but a single
line relay, which controls the lamp in an obvious manner.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Page 82]</a></span></p>

<br /><b>Fig. 349. Western Electric No. 10 Board</b><br />

<p>The cord circuit is of the three-conductor type, the two talking
strands extending to the usual split repeating-coil arrangement, and
battery current for talking purposes being fed through these windings
as in the standard No. 1 board. The supervisory relay is included
in the ring strand of the cord circuit and is shunted by a non-inductive
resistance, so that its impedance will not interfere with the talking
currents. The armature of the supervisory relay closes the lamp
contact on its back stroke, so that the lamp is always held extinguished
when the relay is energized. The supervisory lamp is included
in a connection between the back contact of the supervisory relay
and ground, this connection including the central-office battery.
As a result, the illumination of the supervisory lamp is impossible until
a plug has been inserted into a jack, in which case, assuming the
supervisory relay to be de-energized, the lamp circuit is completed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Page 83]</a></span>through the wire connecting all of the test thimbles and the resistance
permanently bridged to ground from that wire.</p>

<p><i>Test.</i> For purposes of the test it is evident that the test rings
of an idle line are always at ground potential, due to their connection
to ground through the resistance coil. It is also evident that the tip
of an unused calling plug will always be at ground potential and,
therefore, that the testing of an idle line will result in no click in
the operator's receiver. When a line is switched, however, the potential
of all the test rings will be raised due to their being connected
with the live pole of the battery through the third strand of the cord.
When the operator in testing touches the test contact of the jack of a
busy line, a current will, therefore, flow from this test contact to the tip
strand of the cord and thence to ground through one of the repeating
coil windings. The potential of the tip side of the cord will, therefore,
be momentarily altered, and this will result in a click in the
operator's receiver bridged across the cord circuit at the time. The
details of the operator's cord circuit and of the pilot lamp and night
alarm circuits will be clear from the diagram.</p>

<p><i>Operation.</i> A brief summary of the operation of this system is
as follows:</p>

<p>The subscriber removes his receiver from its hook, thus drawing
up the armature of the line relay and lighting his line lamp. The
operator answers. The line lamp is extinguished by the falling back
of the line-relay armature, due to the breaking of the relay circuit
at the jack contacts. The subscriber then receives current for his
transmitter through the cord-circuit battery connections. The
supervisory relay connected with the answering cord is not lighted,
because, although the lamp-circuit connection is completed at the
jack, the supervisory relay is operated to hold the lamp circuit
open. Conversation ensues between the operator and the subscriber,
after which the operator tests the line called for with the
tip of the calling plug of the pair used in answering. If the called
line is not busy, no click will ensue, because both the tested ring
and the calling plug are at the same potential. Finding no click,
the operator will insert the plug and ring by means of the ringing
key. When the operator plugs in, the supervisory lamp, associated
with the calling plug, becomes lighted because the circuit is completed
at the jack and the supervisory relay remains de-energized, since the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Page 84]</a></span>line circuit is open at the subscriber's station. When the called
subscriber responds, the calling supervisory lamp goes out because
of the energization of the supervisory relay. Both lamps remain out
during the conversation, but when either subscriber hangs up, the
corresponding supervisory lamp will be lighted because of the falling
back of the supervisory relay armature.</p>

<p>If the called line is busy, a click will be heard, for the reason described,
and the operator will so inform the calling subscriber. It
goes without saying, that in any multiple-switchboard system a
plug may be found in the actual multiple jack that is reached for,
in which case, although no test will be made, the busy condition
will be reported back to the calling subscriber.</p>

<p><i>Economy.</i> It has been the belief of the Western Electric engineers
that a real economy is accomplished in this type of board by the
saving in relay equipment. It is, of course, apparent at a glance
that with a switchboard long enough and of sections enough, the
cost of extra jack springs and their platinum contacts must become
great enough to offset the saving accomplished by omitting the cut-off
relay. This makes it apparent that if there is any economy in
this type of multiple switchboard, it must be found in the very small
boards where there are but few jacks per line and where the extra
cost of the cut-off jack is not enough to offset the extra cost of an
added relay. It is the growing belief, however, among engineers,
that the multiple switchboard must be very small indeed in order that
the added complexity of the cut-off jacks and wiring may be able
to save anything over the two-relay type of line; and it is believed that
where economy is necessary in small boards, it may be best effected
by employing cheaper and more compact forms of relays and mounting
them, if necessary, directly in the switchboard cabinet.</p>

<blockquote><p><span class="smcap">Note.</span> These two standard types of common-battery multiple switchboards
of the Western Electric Company represent the development through
long years of careful work on the part of the Western Electric and Bell
engineers, credit being particularly due to Scribner, McBerty, and McQuarrie
of the Western Electric Company, and Hayes of the American Telephone and
Telegraph Company.</p></blockquote>

<p><b>Kellogg Two-Wire Multiple Board.</b> The simplicity in the jacks
permitted by the use of the cut-off relay in the Western Electric
common-battery multiple switchboard for larger exchanges was
carried a step further by Dunbar and Miller in the development of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Page 85]</a></span>the so-called two-wire common-battery multiple switchboard, which
for many years has been the standard of the Kellogg Switchboard
and Supply Company. The particular condition which led to the
development of the two-wire system was the demand at that time on
the Kellogg Company for certain very large multiple switchboards,
involving as many as 18,000 lines in the multiple. Obviously, this
necessitated a small jack, and obviously a jack having only two
contacts, a tip spring and a sleeve, could be made more easily and
with greater durability of this very small size than a jack requiring
three or more contacts. Other reasons that were considered were,
of course, cheapness in cost of construction and extreme simplicity,
which, other things being equal, lends itself to low cost of maintenance.</p>

<p><i>Line Circuit.</i> Like the standard Western Electric board for
large offices, the Kellogg two-wire board employs two relays for
each line, the line relay under the control of the subscriber and in
turn controlling the lamp, and a cut-off relay under the control of
the operator and in turn controlling the connection of the line relay
with the line. The line circuit as originally developed and as widely
used by the Kellogg Company is shown in Fig. 350. The extreme
simplicity of the jacks is apparent, as is also the fact that but two
wires lead through the multiple. Another distinguishing feature is,
that all of the multiple and answering jacks are normally cut off
from the line at the cut-off relay, but when the cut-off relay operates
it serves, in addition to cutting off the line relay, to attach the
two limbs of the line to the two wires leading through the multiple and
answering jacks. The control of the line relay by the subscriber's
switch hook is clear from the figure. The control of the cut-off
relay is secured by attaching one terminal of the cut-off relay winding
permanently to that wire leading through the multiple which connects
with the sleeve contacts of the jack, the other terminal of the
cut-off relay being grounded. The way in which this relay is operated
will be understood when it is stated that the sleeve contacts of
both the answering and calling plugs always carry full battery potential
and, therefore, whenever any plug is inserted into any jack, current
flows from the sleeve of the jack through the sleeve contact of the jack
to ground, through the winding of the cut-off relay, which relay becomes
energized and performs the functions just stated. It is seen that the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Page 86]</a></span>wire running through the multiple to which the sleeve jack contacts
are attached, is thus made to serve the double purpose of answering
as one side of the talking circuit, and also of performing the functions
carried out by the separate or third wire in the three-wire system.
It will be shown also that, in addition, this wire is made to lend itself
to the purposes of the busy test without any of these functions interfering
with each other in any way.</p>

<a href="images/fig350.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>Cord Circuit.</i> The cord circuit in somewhat simplified form is
shown in Fig. 351. Here again there are but two conductors to the
plugs and two strands to the cords. This greater simplicity is in
some measure offset by the fact that four relays are required, two
for each plug. This so-called four-relay cord circuit may be most
readily understood by considering half of it at a time, since the two
relays associated with the answering plug act in exactly the same
way as those connected with the calling plug.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig351_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 351. Two-Wire Cord Circuit</b><br />
<a href="images/fig351.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Associated with each plug of a pair are two relays <i>1</i> and <i>2</i>, in the
case of the answering cord, and <i>3</i> and <i>4</i> in the case of the calling
cord. The coils of the relays <i>1</i> and <i>2</i> are connected in series and
bridged across the answering cord, a battery being included between
the coils in this circuit. The coils of the relays <i>3</i> and <i>4</i> are
similarly connected across the calling cord. A peculiar feature of the
Kellogg system is that two batteries are used in connection with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Page 87]</a></span>the cord circuit, one of them being common to all answering cords
and the other to all calling cords. The operation of the system
would, however, be exactly the same if a single battery were substituted
for the two.</p>

<p><i>Supervisory Signals.</i> Considering the relays associated with
the answering cord, it is obvious that these two relays <i>1</i> and <i>2</i>
together control the circuit of the supervisory lamp <i>5</i>, the circuit of
this lamp being closed only when the relay <i>1</i> is de-energized and the
relay <i>2</i> is energized. We will find in discussing the operation of
these that the relay <i>2</i> is wholly under the control of the operator, and
that the relay <i>1</i>, after its plug has been connected with a line, is wholly
under the control of the subscriber on that line. It is through the
windings of these two relays that current is fed to the line of the subscriber
connected with the corresponding cord.</p>

<p>When a plug&mdash;the answering plug, for instance&mdash;is inserted into
a jack, current at once flows from the positive pole of the left-hand
battery through the winding of the relay <i>2</i> to the sleeve of the plug,
thence to the sleeve of the jack and through the cut-off relay to
ground. This at once energizes the supervisory relay <i>2</i> and the cut-off
relay associated with the line. The cut-off relay acts, as stated,
to continue the tip and sleeve wires associated with the jacks to the line
leading to the subscriber, and also to cut off the line relay. The supervisory
relay <i>2</i> acts at the same time to attract its armature and thus
complete its part in closing the circuit of the supervisory lamp.
Whether or not the lamp will be lighted at this time depends on whether
the relay <i>1</i> is energized or not, and this, it will be seen, depends
on whether the subscriber's receiver is off or on its hook. If off its
hook, current will flow through the metallic circuit of the line for
energizing the subscriber's transmitter, and as whatever current goes
to the subscriber's line must flow through the relay <i>1</i>, that relay will be
energized and prevent the lighting of the supervisory lamp <i>5</i>. If,
on the other hand, the subscriber's receiver is on its hook, no current
will flow through the line, the supervisory relay will not be energized,
and the lamp <i>5</i> will be lighted.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, the sleeve supervisory relay normally prevents the
lighting of the corresponding supervisory lamp, but as soon as the
operator inserts a plug into the jack of the line, the relay <i>2</i> establishes
such a condition as to make possible the lighting of the supervisory
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Page 88]</a></span>lamp, and the lighting of this lamp is then controlled entirely by the
relay <i>1</i>, which is, in turn, controlled by the position of the subscriber's
switch hook.</p>

<p><i>Battery Feed.</i> A 2-microfarad condenser is included in each
strand of the cord, and battery is fed through the relay windings
to the calling and called subscribers on opposite sides of these condensers,
in accordance with the combined impedance coil and condenser
method described in Chapter XIII. Here the relay windings
do double duty, serving as magnets for operating the relays and as
retardation coils in the system of battery supply.</p>

<p><i>Complete Cord and Line Circuits.</i> The complete cord and
line circuits of the Kellogg two-wire system are shown in Fig. 352.
In the more recent installations of the Kellogg Company the cord
and line circuits have been slightly changed from those shown in
Figs. 350 and 351, and these changes have been incorporated in Fig.
352. The principles of operation described in connection with the
simplified figures remain, however, exactly the same. One of the
changes is, that the tip side of the lines is permanently connected to
the tips of the jacks instead of being normally cut off by the cut-off
relay, as was done in the system as originally developed. Another
change is, that the line relay is associated with the tip side of the
line, rather than with the sleeve side, as was formerly done. The
cord circuit shown in Fig. 352 shows exactly the same arrangement
of supervisory relays and exactly the same method of battery feed as
in the simplified cord circuit of Fig. 351, but in addition to this the
detailed connections of the operator's talking set and of her order-wire
keys are indicated, and also the ringing equipment is indicated
as being adapted for four-party harmonic work.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 352. Kellogg Two-Wire Board</b><br />

<p>In connection with this ringing key it may be stated that the
springs <i>7</i>, <i>8</i>, <i>9</i>, and <i>10</i> are individually operated by the pressure of
one of the ringing key buttons, while the spring <i>17</i>, connected
with the sleeve side of the calling plug, is always operated simultaneously
with the operation of any one of the other springs. As a result
the proper ringing circuit is established, it being understood
that the upper contacts of the springs <i>7</i>, <i>8</i>, <i>9</i>, and <i>10</i> lead to the
terminals of their respective ringing generators, the other terminals
of which are grounded. The circuit is, therefore, from the generator,
through the ringing key, out through the tip side of the line, back over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Page 90]</a></span>the sleeve side of the line, and to ground through the spring <i>17</i>, resistance
<i>11</i>, and the battery, which is one of the cord-circuit batteries.
The object of this coil <i>11</i> and the battery connection through it to the
ringing-key spring is to prevent the falling back of the cut-off relay
when the ringing key is operated. This will be clear when it is remembered
that the cut-off relay is energized by battery current fed
over the sleeve strand of the cord, and obviously, since it is necessary
when the ringing key is operated to cut off the supply wire back of the
key, this would de-energize the cut-off relay when the ringing key
was depressed, and the falling back of the cut-off relay contacts
would make it impossible to ring because the sleeve side of the line
would be cut off. The battery supply through the resistance <i>11</i> is,
therefore, substituted on the sleeve strand of the cord for the battery
supply through the normal connection.</p>

<p><i>Busy Test.</i> The busy test depends on all of the test rings being
at zero potential on an idle line and at a higher potential on a busy
line. Obviously, when the line is not switched, the test rings are at
zero potential on account of a ground through the cut-off relay.
When, however, a plug is inserted in either the answering or multiple
jacks, the test rings will all be raised in potential due to being connected
with the live side of the battery through the sleeve strand
of the cord. Conditions on the line external to the central office cannot
make an idle line test busy because, owing to the presence of
the cut-off relay, the sleeve contacts of all the jacks are disconnected
from the line when it is idle. The test circuit from the tip of the
calling plug to ground at the operator's set passes through the tip
strand of the cord, thence through a pair of normally closed extra
contacts on the supervisory relay <i>4</i>, thence in series through all the
ringing key springs <i>10</i>, <i>9</i>, <i>8</i>, and <i>7</i>, thence through an extra pair
of springs <i>12</i> and <i>13</i> on the listening key&mdash;closed only when the listening
key is operated&mdash;and thence to ground through a retardation
coil <i>14</i>. No battery or other source of potential exists in this circuit
between ground and the tip of the calling plug and, therefore, the
tip is normally at ground potential. The sleeve ring of the jack
being at ground potential if the line is idle, no current will flow
and no click will be produced in testing such a line. If, however,
the line is busy, the test ring will be at a higher potential and, therefore,
current will flow from the tip of the calling plug to ground
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Page 91]</a></span>over the path just traced, and this will cause a rise in potential at
the terminal of the condenser <i>15</i> and a momentary flow of current
through the tertiary winding <i>16</i> of the operator's induction coil;
hence the click.</p>

<p>Obviously the testing circuit from the tip of the calling plug to
ground at the operator's set is only useful during the time when the
calling plug is not in a jack, and as the tip strand of the calling plug
has to do double duty in testing and in serving as a part of the talking
circuit, the arrangement is made that the testing circuit will be automatically
broken and the talking circuit through the tip strand automatically
completed when the plug is inserted into a jack in establishing
a connection. This is accomplished by means of the extra
contact on the relay <i>4</i>, which relay, it will be remembered, is held
energized when its corresponding plug is inserted in a jack. During
the time when the plug is not inserted, this relay is not energized
and the test circuit is completed through the back contact of its right-hand
armature. When connection is made at the jack, this relay
becomes energized and the tip strand of the cord circuit is made complete
by the right-hand lever being pulled against the front contact
of this relay. The keys shown to the right of the operator's set are
order-wire keys.</p>

<p><i>Summary of Operation.</i> We may give a brief summary of the
operation of this system as shown in Fig. 352. The left-hand station
calls and the line relay pulls up, lighting the lamp. The operator
inserts an answering plug in the answering jack, thus energizing the
cut-off relay which operates to cut off the line relay and to complete
the connection between the jacks and the external line. The act of
plugging in by the operator also raises the potential of all the test
rings so as to guard the line against intrusion by other callers. The
supervisory lamp <i>5</i> remains unlighted because, although the relay
<i>2</i> is operated, the relay <i>1</i> is also operated, due to the calling subscriber's
receiver being off its hook. The operator throws her listening key,
communicates with the subscriber, and, learning that the right-hand
station is wanted, proceeds to test that line. If the line is idle,
she will get no click, because the tip of her calling plug and the tested
ring will be at the same ground potential. She then plugs in and
presses the proper ringing-key button to send out the proper frequency
to ring the particular subscriber on the line&mdash;if there be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Page 92]</a></span>more than one&mdash;the current from the battery through the coil <i>11</i> and
spring <i>17</i> serving during this operation to hold up the cut-off relay.</p>

<p>As soon as the operator plugs in with the calling plug, the supervisory
lamp <i>6</i> lights, assuming that the called subscriber had not
already removed his receiver from its hook, due to the fact that
the relay <i>4</i> is energized and the relay <i>3</i> is not. As soon as the
called subscriber responds, the relay <i>3</i> becomes energized and the
supervisory lamp goes out. If the line called for had been busy
by virtue of being plugged at another section, the tip of the operator's
plug in testing would have found the test ring raised to a
potential above the ground, and, as a consequence, current would
have flowed from the tip of this plug through the back contact of
the right-hand lever of relay <i>4</i>, thence through the ringing key springs
and the auxiliary listening-key springs to ground through the retardation
coil <i>14</i>. This would have produced a click by causing a momentary
flow of current through the tertiary winding <i>16</i> of the operator's set.</p>

<p><i>Wiring of Line Circuit.</i> The more complete wiring diagram of
a single subscriber's line, Fig. 353, shows the placing in the circuits
of the terminals and jumper wires of the main distributing frame
and of the intermediate distributing frame, and also shows how the
pilot lamps and night-alarm circuits are associated with a group
of lines. The main distributing frame occupies the same relative
position in this line circuit as in the Western Electric, being located
in the main line circuit outside of all the switchboard apparatus.
The intermediate distributing frame occupies a different relative
position from that in the Western Electric line. It will be recalled
by reference to Fig. 348 that the line lamp and the answering jack were
permanently associated with the line and cut-off relays, such mutations
of arrangement as were possible at the intermediate distributing
frame serving only to vary the connection between the multiple
of a line and one of the various groups of apparatus consisting of an
answering jack and line lamp and associated relays. In the Kellogg
arrangement, Fig. 353, the line and cut-off relays, instead of being
permanently associated with the answering jack and line lamp,
are permanently associated with the multiple jacks, no changes, of
which the intermediate or main frames are capable, being able to
alter the relation between a group of multiple jacks and its associated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Page 93]</a></span>line and cut-off relays. In this Kellogg arrangement the intermediate
distributing frame may only alter the connection of an answering
jack and line lamp with the multiple and its permanently associated
relays. The pilot and night alarm arrangements of Fig. 353
should be obvious from the description already given of other similar
systems.</p>

multiple switchboard of the Dean Electric Company. The subscriber's
station equipment shown at Station <i>A</i> and Station <i>B</i> will be
recognized as the Wheatstone-bridge circuit of the Dean Company.</p>

<p><i>Line Circuit.</i> The line circuit is easily understood in view of
what has been said concerning the Western Electric line circuit, the
line relay <i>1</i> being single wound and between the live side of the
battery and the ring side of the line. The cut-off relay <i>2</i> is operated
whenever a plug is inserted in a jack and serves to sever the connection
of the line with the normal line signaling apparatus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Page 94]</a></span></p><p><i>Cord Circuit.</i> The cord circuit is of the four-relay type, but
employs three conductors instead of two, as in the two-wire system.
The relay <i>3</i>, being in series between the battery and the sleeve contact
on the plug, is energized whenever a plug is inserted in the
jack, its winding being placed in series with the cut-off relay of the
line with which the plug is connected. This completes the circuit
through the associated supervisory lamp unless the relay <i>4</i> is energized,
the local lamp circuit being controlled by the back contact of
relay <i>4</i> and the front contact of relay <i>3</i>. It is through the two
windings of the relay <i>4</i> that current is fed to the subscriber's station, and,
therefore, the armature of this relay is responsive to the movements
of the subscriber's hook. As the relay <i>3</i> holds the supervisory lamp
circuit closed as long as a plug is inserted in a jack of the line, it
follows that during a connection the relay <i>4</i> will have entire control
of the supervisory lamp.</p>

<p><i>Listening Key.</i> The listening key, as usual, serves to connect
the operator's set across the talking strands of the cord circuit, and
the action of this in connection with the operator's set needs no further
explanation.</p>

<p><i>Ringing Keys.</i> The ringing-key arrangement illustrated is
adapted for use with harmonic ringing, the single springs <i>5</i>, <i>6</i>, <i>7</i>,
and <i>8</i> each being controlled by a separate button and serving to
select the particular frequency that is to be sent to line. The two
springs <i>9</i> and <i>10</i> always act to open the cord circuit back of the
ringing keys, whenever any one of the selective buttons is depressed, in
order to prevent interference by ringing current with the other operations
of the circuit.</p>

<p>Two views of these ringing keys are shown in Figs. 355 and 356.
Fig. 356 is an end view of the entire set. In Fig. 355 the listening key
is shown at the extreme right and the four selective buttons at the
left. When a button is released it rises far enough to cause the disengagement
of the contacts, but remains partially depressed to serve
as an indication that it was last used. The group of springs at the
extreme left of Fig. 355 are the ones represented at <i>9</i> and <i>10</i> in Fig.
354 and by the anvils with which those springs co-operate.</p>

<p><i>Test.</i> The test in this Dean system is simple, and, like the
Western Electric and Kellogg systems, it depends on the raising of
the potential of the test thimbles of all the line jacks of a line when
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Page 96]</a></span>a connection is made with that line by a plug at any position. When
an operator makes a test by applying the tip of the calling plug to
the test thimble of a busy line, current passes from the test thimble
through the tip strand of the cord to ground through the left-hand
winding of the calling supervisory relay <i>4</i>. The drop of potential
through this winding causes the tip strand of the cord to be raised to
a higher potential than it was before, and as a result
the upper plate of the condenser <i>11</i> is thus altered in
potential and this change in potential across the condenser
results in a click in the operator's ear.</p>

<p><b>Stromberg-Carlson Multiple Board.</b> <i>Line Circuit.</i>
In Fig. 357 is shown the multiple common-battery
switchboard circuits employed by the Stromberg-Carlson
Telephone Manufacturing Company. The
subscriber's line circuits shown in this drawing are
of the three-wire type and, with the exception of
the subscriber's station, are the same as already
described for the Western Electric Company's system.</p>

<p><i>Cord Circuit.</i> The cord circuit employed is of the
two-conductor type, the plugs being so constructed as
to connect the ring and thimble contacts of the jack when inserted.
This cord circuit is somewhat similar to that employed by the
Kellogg Switchboard and Supply Company, shown in Fig. 352,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Page 97]</a></span>except that only one battery is employed, and that certain functions
of this circuit are performed mechanically by the inter-action of the
armatures of the relays.</p>

<p><i>Supervisory Signals.</i> When the answering plug is inserted
in a jack, in response to a call, the current passing to the subscriber's
station and also through the cut-off relay must flow through the relay
<i>1</i>, thus energizing it. As the calling subscriber's receiver is at this
time removed from the hook switch, the path for current will be completed
through the tip of the jack, thence through the tip of the plug,
through relay <i>2</i> to ground, causing relay <i>2</i> to be operated and to break
the circuit of the answering supervisory lamp. The two relays <i>1</i> and
<i>2</i> are so associated mechanically that the armature of <i>1</i> controls the
armature of <i>2</i> in such a manner as to normally hold the circuit of
the answering supervisory lamp open. But, however, when the plug
is inserted in a jack, relay <i>1</i> is operated and allows the operation of
relay <i>2</i> to be controlled by the hook switch at the subscriber's station.
The supervisory relay <i>3</i> associated with the calling cord is
operated when the calling plug is placed in a jack, and this relay
normally holds the armature of relay <i>4</i> in an operated position in a
similar manner as the armature of relay <i>1</i> controlled that of relay
<i>2</i>. Supervisory relay <i>4</i> is under the control of the hook switch at
the called subscriber's station.</p>

<p><i>Test.</i> In this circuit, as in several previously described, when
a plug is inserted in a jack of a line, the thimble contacts of the jacks
associated with that line are raised to a higher potential than that
which they normally have. The operator in testing a busy line, of
course having previously moved the listening key to the listening
position, closes a path from the test thimble of the jack, through
the tip of the calling plug, through the contacts of the relay <i>4</i>, the
inside springs of the listening key, thence through a winding of the
induction coil associated with her set to ground. The circuit thus
established allows current to flow from the test thimble of the jack
through the winding of her induction coil to ground, causing a click
in her telephone receiver. The arrangement of the ringing circuit
does not differ materially from that already described for other systems
and, therefore, needs no further explanation.</p>

<p><b>Multiple Switchboard Apparatus.</b> Coming now to a discussion
of the details of apparatus employed in multiple switchboards, it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Page 99]</a></span>be stated that much of the apparatus used in the simpler types is
capable of doing duty in multiple switchboards, although, of course,
modification in detail is often necessary to make the apparatus fit
the particular demands of the system in which it is to be used.</p>

<p><i>Jacks.</i> Probably the most important piece of apparatus in the
multiple switchboard is the jack, its importance being increased by
the fact that such very large numbers of them are sometimes necessary.
Switchboards having hundreds of thousands of jacks are not uncommon.
The multiple jacks are nearly always mounted in strips of
twenty and the answering jacks usually in strips of ten, the length of
the jack strip being the same in each case in the same board and,
therefore, giving twice as wide a spacing in the answering as in the
multiple jacks. The distance between centers in the multiple jacks
varies from a quarter of an inch&mdash;which is perhaps the extreme minimum&mdash;to
half an inch, beyond which larger limit there seems to be
no need of going in any case. It is customary that the jack strip
shall be made of the same total thickness as the distance between
the centers of two of its jacks, and from this it follows that the strips
when piled one upon the other give the same vertical distance
between jack centers as the horizontal distance.</p>

<p>In Fig. 358 is shown a strip of multiple and a strip of answering
jacks of Western Electric make, this being the type employed in
the No. 1 standard switchboards for large exchanges. In Fig. 359 are
shown the multiple and answering jacks employed in the No. 10
Western Electric switchboard. The multiple jacks in the No. 1
switchboard are mounted on <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub></span>-inch centers, the jacks having three
branch terminal contacts. The multiple jacks of the No. 10 switchboard
indicated in Fig. 359 are mounted on <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>-inch centers, each
jack having five contacts as indicated by the requirement of the circuits
in Fig. 349.</p>

<p>In Fig. 360 are shown the answering and multiple jacks of the
Kellogg Switchboard and Supply Company's two-wire system. The
extreme simplicity of these is particularly well shown in the cut of
the answering jack, and these figures also show clearly the customary
method of numbering jacks. In very large multiple boards it has
been the practice of the Kellogg Company to space the multiple
jacks on <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span>-inch centers, and in their smaller multiple work, they
employ the <span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span>-inch spacing. With the <span class="frac"><sup>3</sup>/<sub>10</sub></span>-inch spacing that company
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Page 100]</a></span>has been able to build boards having a capacity of 18,000 lines, that
many jacks being placed within the reach of each operator.</p>

<p>In all modern multiple switchboards the test thimble or sleeve
contacts are drawn up from sheet brass or German silver into tubular
form and inserted in properly spaced borings in strips of hard rubber
forming the faces of the jacks. These strips sometimes are reinforced
by brass strips on their under sides. The springs forming the
other terminals of the jack are mounted in milled slots in another
strip of hard rubber mounted in the rear of and parallel to the front
strip and rigidly attached thereto by a suitable metal framework. In
this way desired rigidity and high insulation between the various
parts is secured.</p>

<p><i>Lamp Jacks.</i> The lamp jacks employed in multiple work need
no further description in view of what has been said in connection
with lamp jacks for simple common-battery boards. The lamp
jack spacing is always the same as the answering jack spacing, so that
the lamps will come in the same vertical alignment as their corresponding
answering jacks when the lamp strips and answering jack
strips are mounted in alternate layers.</p>

<p><i>Relays.</i> Next in order of importance in the matter of individual
parts for multiple switchboards is the relay. The necessity for
reliability of action in these is apparent, and this means that they
must not only be well constructed, but that they must be protected
from dust and moisture and must have contact points of such a nature
as not to corrode even in the presence of considerable sparking
and of the most adverse atmospheric conditions. Economy of space
is also a factor and has led to the almost universal adoption of the
single-magnet type of relay for line and cut-off as well as supervisory
purposes.</p>

<p>The Western Electric Company employs different types of relays
for line, cut-off, and supervisory purposes. This is contrary
to the practice of most of the other companies who make the same
general type of relay serve for all of these purposes. A good idea of
the type of Western Electric line relay, as employed in its No. 1 board,
may be had from Fig. 361. As is seen this is of the tilting armature
type, the armature rocking back and forth on a knife-edge contact at
its base, the part on which it rests being of iron and of such form as
to practically complete, with the armature and core, the magnetic
circuit. The cut-off relay, Fig. 362, is of an entirely different type.
The armature in this is loosely suspended by means of a flexible
spring underneath two <b>L</b>-shaped polar extensions, one extending up
from the rear end of the core and the other from the front end.
When energized this armature is pulled away from the core by these
<b>L</b>-shaped pieces and imparts its motion through a hard-rubber pin
to the upper pair of springs so as to effect the necessary changes in
the circuit.</p>

<p>Much economy in space and in wiring is secured in the type
of switchboards employing cut-off as well as line relays by mounting
the two relays together and in making of them, in fact, a unitary
piece of apparatus. Since the line relay is always associated with
the cut-off relay of the same line and with no other, it is obvious
that this unitary arrangement effects a great saving in wiring and
also secures a great advantage in the matter of convenience of
inspection. Such a combined cut-off and line relay, employed in
the Western Electric No. 1 relay board, is shown in Fig. 363.
These are mounted in banks of ten pairs, a common dust cap
of sheet iron covering the entire group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Page 104]</a></span></p><p>The Western Electric supervisory relay, Fig. 364, is of the tilting
armature type and is copper clad. The dust cap in this case fits
on with a bayonet joint as clearly indicated. In Fig. 365 is shown
the line relay employed in the Western Electric No. 10 board.</p>

<p>The Kellogg Company employs the type of relay of which the
magnetic circuit was illustrated in Fig. 95. In its multiple boards it
commonly mounts the line and cut-off relays together, as shown in
Fig. 366. A single, soft iron shell is used to cover both of these,
thus serving as a dust shield and also as a magnetic shield to prevent
cross-talk between adjacent relays&mdash;an important feature, since
it will be remembered the cut-off relays are left permanently connected
with the talking circuit. Fig. 367, which shows a strip of
twenty such pairs of relays, from five of which the covers have been
removed, is an excellent detail view of the general practice in this
respect; obviously, a very large number of such relays may be mounted
in a comparatively small space. The mounting strip shown in this
cut is of heavy rolled iron and is provided with openings through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Page 105]</a></span>which the connection terminals&mdash;shown more clearly in Fig. 366&mdash;project.
On the back of this mounting strip all the wiring is done
and much of this wiring&mdash;that connecting adjacent terminals on the
back of the relay strip&mdash;is made by means of thin copper wires
without insulation, the wires being so short as to support themselves
without danger of crossing with other wires. When these wires are
adjacent to ground or battery wires they may be protected by sleeving,
so as to prevent crosses.</p>

<p>An interesting feature in relay construction is found in the
relay of the Monarch Telephone Manufacturing Company shown
in Figs. 368 and 369. The assembled relay and its mounting
strip and cap are shown in Fig. 368. This relay is so constructed
that by the lifting of a single latch not only the armature
but the coil may be bodily removed, as shown in Fig. 369, in
which the latch is shown in its raised position. As seen, the
armature has an <b>L</b>-shaped projection which serves to operate the
contact springs lying on the iron plate above the coil. The simplicity
of this device is attractive, and it is of convenience not only
from the standpoint of easy repairs but also from the standpoint
of factory assembly, since by manufacturing standard coils with
different characters of windings and standard groups of springs, it
is possible to produce without special manufacture almost any
combination of relay.</p>

<p><b>Assembly.</b> The arrangement of the key and jack equipment in
complete multiple switchboard sections is clearly shown in Fig. 370,
which shows a single three-position section of one of the small
multiple switchboards of the Kellogg Switchboard and Supply Company.
The arrangement of keys and plugs on the key shelf is substantially
the same as in simple common-battery boards. As in the
simple switchboards the supervisory lamps are usually mounted on
the hinged key shelf immediately in the rear of the listening and
ringing keys and with such spacing as to lie immediately in front of
the plugs to which they correspond. The reason for mounting the
supervisory lamps on the key shelf is to make them easy of access
in case of the necessity of lamp renewals or repairs on the wiring.
The space at the bottom of the vertical panels, containing the jacks,
is left blank, as this space is obstructed by the standing plugs in
front of it. Above the plugs, however, are seen the alternate
strips of line lamps and answering jacks, the lamps in each case
being directly below the corresponding answering jacks. Above
the line lamps and answering jacks in the two positions at the
right there are blank strips into which additional line lamps and
jacks may be placed in case the future needs of the system demand
it. The space above these is the multiple jack space, and it is evident
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Page 107]</a></span>from the small number of multiple jacks in this little switchboard
that the present equipment of the board is small. It is also
evident from the amount of blank space left for future installations
of multiple jacks that a considerable growth is expected. Thus,
while there are but four banks of 100 multiple jacks, or 400 in all,
there is room in the multiple for 300 banks of 100 multiple jacks, or
3,000 in all. The method of grouping the jacks in banks of 100 and
of providing for their future growth is clearly indicated in this figure.
The next section at the right of the one shown would contain a duplicate
set of multiple jacks and also an additional equipment of answering
jacks and lamps.</p>

<p>For ordinary local service no operator would sit at the left-hand
position of the section shown, that being the end position, since
the operator there would not be able easily to reach the extreme
right-hand portion of the third position and would have nothing to
reach at her left. This end position in this particular board illustrated
is provided with toll-line equipment, a practice not uncommon
in small multiple boards. To prevent confusion let us assume
that the multiple jack space contains its full equipment of 3,000
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Page 108]</a></span>jacks on each section. The operator in the center position of the
section shown could easily reach any one of the jacks on that section.
The operator at the third position could reach any jack on the
second and third position of her section, but could not well reach
multiple jacks in the first position. She would, however, have a
duplicate of the multiple jacks in this first position in the section at
her right, <i>i. e.</i>, in the fourth position, and it makes no difference on
what portion of the switchboard she plugs into the multiple so long
as she plugs into a jack of the right line.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII"></a>CHAPTER XXVII<br />

<span style="font-size:80%;">TRUNKING IN MULTI-OFFICE SYSTEMS</span></h2>


<p>It has been stated that a single exchange may involve a number
of offices, in which case it is termed a multi-office exchange. In a
multi-office exchange, switchboards are necessary at each office in
which the subscribers' lines of the corresponding office district terminate.
Means for intercommunication between the subscribers
in one office and those in any other office are afforded by inter-office
trunks extended between each office and each of the other offices.</p>

<p>If the character of the community is such that each of the offices
has so few lines as to make the simple switchboard suffice for its local
connections, then the trunking between the offices may be carried
out in exactly the same way as explained between the various simple
switchboards in a transfer system, the only difference being that the
trunks are long enough to reach from one office to another instead of
being short and entirely local to a single office. Such a condition of
affairs would only be found in cases where several small communities
were grouped closely enough together to make them operate as
a single exchange district, and that is rather unusual.</p>

<p>The subject of inter-office trunking so far as manual switchboards
are concerned is, therefore, confined mainly to trunking between
a number of offices each equipped with a manual multiple switchboard.</p>

<p><b>Necessity for Multi-Office Exchanges.</b> Before taking up the
details of the methods and circuits employed in trunking in multi-office
systems, it may be well to discuss briefly why the multi-office
exchange is a necessity, and why it would not be just as well to serve
all of the subscribers in a large city from a single huge switchboard
in which all of the subscribers' lines would terminate. It cannot be
denied, when other things are equal, that it is better to have only
one operator involved in any connection which means less labor and
less liability of error.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Page 110]</a></span></p><p>The reasons, however, why this is not feasible in really large
exchanges are several. The main one is that of the larger investment
required. Considering the investment first from the standpoint
of the subscriber's line, it is quite clear that the average length
of subscriber's line will be very much greater in a given community
if all of the lines are run to a single office, than will be the case if the
exchange district is divided into smaller office districts and the lines run
merely from the subscribers to the nearest office. There is a direct
and very large gain in this respect, in the multi-office system over the
single office system in large cities, but this is not a net gain, since
there is an offsetting investment necessary in the trunk lines between
the offices, which of course are separate from the subscribers' lines.</p>

<p>Approaching the matter from the standpoint of switchboard
construction and operation, another strong reason becomes apparent
for the employment of more than one office in large exchange districts.
Both the difficulties of operation and the expense of construction
and maintenance increase very rapidly when switchboards
grow beyond a certain rather well-defined limit. Obviously, the
limitation of the multiple switchboard as to size involves the number
of multiple jacks that it is feasible to place on a section. Multiple
switchboards have been constructed in this country in which the
sections had a capacity of 18,000 jacks. Schemes have been proposed
and put into effect with varying success, for doubling and
quadrupling the capacity of multiple switchboards, one of these
being the so-called divided multiple board devised by the late Milo
G. Kellogg, and once used in Cleveland, Ohio, and St. Louis, Missouri.
Each of these boards had an ultimate capacity of 24,000 lines,
and each has been replaced by a "straight" multiple board of smaller
capacity. In general, the present practice in America does not
sanction the building of multiple boards of more than about 10,000
lines capacity, and as an example of this it may be cited that the
largest standard section manufactured for the Bell companies has an
ultimate capacity of 9,600 lines.</p>

<p>European engineers have shown a tendency towards the opposite
practice, and an example of the extreme in this case is the multiple
switchboard manufactured by the Ericsson Company, and installed
in Stockholm, in which the jacks have been reduced to such small
dimensions as to permit an ultimate capacity of 60,000 lines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Page 111]</a></span></p><p>The reasons governing the decision of American engineers in
establishing the practice of employing no multiple switchboards of
greater capacity than about 10,000 lines, briefly outlined, are as
follows: The building of switchboards with larger capacity, while
perfectly possible, makes necessary either a very small jack or some
added complexity, such as that of the divided multiple switchboard,
either of which is considered objectionable. Extremely small jacks
and large multiples introduce difficulties as to the durability of the
jacks and the plugs, and also they tend to slow down the work of
operators and to introduce errors. They also introduce the necessity
of a smaller gauge of wire through the multiple than it has been found
desirable to employ. Considered from the standpoint of expense,
it is evident that as a multiple switchboard increases in number of
lines, its size increases in two dimensions, <i>i. e.</i>, in length of board
and height of section, and this element of expense, therefore, is a
function of the square of the number of lines.</p>

<p>The matter of insurance, both with respect to the risk as to
property loss and the risk as to breakdown of the service, also points
distinctly in the direction of a plurality of offices rather than one.
Both from the standpoint of risk against fire and other hazards,
which might damage the physical property, and of risk against interruption
to service due to a breakdown of the switchboard itself,
or a failure of its sources of current, or an accident to the cable approaches,
the single office practice is like putting all one's eggs in one
basket.</p>

<p>Another factor that has contributed to the adoption of smaller
switchboard capacities is the fact that in the very large cities even a
40,000 line multiple switchboard would still not remove the necessity
of multi-office exchanges with the consequent certainty that a large
proportion of the calls would have to be trunked anyway.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly, one of the reasons for the difference between
American and European practice is the better results that American
operating companies have been able to secure in the handling of
calls at the incoming end of trunks. This is due, no doubt, in part
to the differences in social and economic conditions under which exchanges
are operated in this country and abroad, and also in part to
the characteristics of the English tongue when compared to some
of the other tongues in the matter of ease with which numbers may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Page 112]</a></span>be spoken. In America it has been found possible to so perfect the
operation of trunking under proper operating conditions and with
good equipment as to relieve multi-office practice of many of the
disadvantages which have been urged against it.</p>

<p><b>Classification.</b> Broadly speaking there are two general methods
that may be employed in trunking between exchanges. The
first and simplest of these methods is to employ so-called <i>two-way
trunks</i>. These, as their name indicates, may be used for completing
connections between offices in either direction, that is, whether the
call originates at one end or the other. The other way is by the
use of <i>one-way trunks</i>, wherein each trunk carries traffic in one
direction only. Where such is the case, one end of the trunk is always
used for connecting with the calling subscriber's line and is termed
the <i>outgoing</i> end, and the other end is always used in completing the
connection with the called subscriber's line, and is referred to as the
<i>incoming</i> end. Traffic in the other direction is handled by another
set of trunks differing from the first set only in that their outgoing
and incoming ends are reversed.</p>

<p>As has already been pointed out, a system of trunks employing
two-way trunks is called a <i>single-track system</i>, and a system involving
two sets of one-way trunks is called a <i>double-track system</i>. It is
to be noted that the terms outgoing and incoming, as applied to the
ends of trunks and also as applied to traffic, always refer to the
direction in which the trunk handles traffic or the direction in which
the traffic is flowing with respect to the particular office under
consideration at the time. Thus an <i>incoming trunk</i> at one office is an
<i>outgoing trunk</i> at the other.</p>

<p><i>Two-Way Trunks.</i> Two-way trunks are nearly always employed
where the traffic is very small and they are nearly always operated
by having the <i>A</i>-operator plug directly into the jack at her end of the
trunk and displaying a signal at the other end by ringing over the
trunk as she would over an ordinary subscriber's line. The operator
at the distant exchange answers as she would on an ordinary
line, by plugging into the jack of that trunk, and receives her orders
over the trunk either from the originating operator or from the subscriber,
and then completes the connection with the called subscriber.
Such trunks are often referred to as "ring-down" trunks, and their
equipment consists in a drop and jack at each end. In case there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Page 113]</a></span>is a multiple board at either or both of the offices, then the equipment
at each end of the trunk would consist of a drop and answering
jack, together with the full quota of multiple jacks. It is readily
seen that this mode of operation is slow, as the work that each operator
has to do is the same as that in connecting two local subscribers,
plus the time that it takes for the operators to communicate with
each other over the trunk.</p>

<p><i>One-Way Trunks.</i> Where one-way trunks are employed in the
double-track system, the trunks, assuming that they connect multiple
boards, are provided with multiple jacks only at their outgoing
ends, so that any operator may reach them for an outgoing connection,
and at their incoming ends they terminate each in a single plug and
in suitable signals and ringing keys, the purpose of which will be
explained later. Over such trunks there is no verbal communication
between the operators, the instructions passing between the operators
over separate order-wire circuits. This is done in order that
the trunk may be available as much as possible for actual conversation
between the subscribers. It may be stated at this point
that the duration of the period from the time when a trunk is appropriated
by the operators for the making of a certain connection until
the time when the trunk is finally released and made available for
another connection is called the <i>holding time</i>, and this holding time
includes not only the period while the subscribers are in actual conversation
over it, but also the periods while the operators are making
the connection and afterwards while they are taking it down. It
may be said, therefore, that the purpose of employing separate order
wires for communication between the operators is to make the
holding time on the trunks as small as possible and, therefore, for
the purpose of enabling a given trunk to take part in as many
connections in a given time as possible.</p>

<p>In outline the operation of a one-way trunk between common-battery,
manual, multiple switchboards is, with modifications that
will be pointed out afterwards, as follows: When a subscriber's
line signal is displayed at one office, the operator in attendance at
that position answers and finding that the call is for a subscriber in
another office, she presses an order-wire key and thereby connects
her telephone set directly with that of a <i>B</i>-operator at the proper
other office. Unless she finds that other operators are talking over the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Page 114]</a></span>order wire, she merely states the number of the called subscriber,
and the <i>B</i>-operator whose telephone set is permanently connected
with that order wire merely repeats the number of the called subscriber
and follows this by designating the number of the trunk
which the <i>A</i>-operator is to employ in making the connection. The
<i>A</i>-operator, thereupon, immediately and without testing, inserts the
calling plug of the pair used in answering the call into the trunk jack
designated by the <i>B</i>-operator; the <i>B</i>-operator simultaneously tests
the multiple jack of the called subscriber and, if she finds it not busy,
inserts the plug of the designated trunk into the multiple jack of the
called subscriber and rings his bell by pressing the ringing key associated
with the trunk cord used. The work on the part of the <i>A</i>-operator
in connecting with the outgoing end of the trunk and on
the part of the <i>B</i>-operator in connecting the incoming end of the
trunk with the line goes on simultaneously, and it makes no difference
which of these operators completes the connection first.</p>

<p>It is the common practice of the Bell operating companies in
this country to employ what is called automatic or machine ringing
in connection with the <i>B</i>-operator's work. When the <i>B</i>-operator
presses the ringing key associated with the incoming trunk cord,
she pays no further attention to it, and she has no supervisory lamp
to inform her as to whether or not the subscriber has answered. The
ringing key is held down, after its depression by the operator, either
by an electromagnet or by a magnet-controlled latch, and the ringing
of the subscriber's bell continues at periodic intervals as controlled
by the ringing commutator associated with the ringing machine.
When the subscriber answers, however, the closure of his line circuit
results in such an operation of the magnet associated with the
ringing key as to release the ringing key and thus to automatically
discontinue the ringing current.</p>

<p>When a connection is established between two subscribers
through such a trunk the supervision of the connection falls entirely
upon the <i>A</i>-operator who established it. This means that the calling
supervisory lamp at the <i>A</i>-operator's position is controlled over the
trunk from the station of the called subscriber, the answering supervisory
lamp being, of course, under the control of the calling subscriber
as in the case of a local connection. It is, therefore, the <i>A</i>-operator
who always initiates the taking down of a trunk connection,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Page 115]</a></span>and when, in response to the lighting of the two lamps, she withdraws
her calling plug from the trunk jack, the supervisory lamp associated
with the incoming end of the trunk at the other office is
lighted, and the <i>B</i>-operator obeys it by pulling down the plug.</p>

<p>If, upon testing the multiple jack of the called subscriber's
line, the <i>B</i>-operator finds the line to be busy, she at once inserts the
trunk plug into a so-called "busy-back" jack, which is merely a jack
whose terminals are permanently connected to a circuit that is intermittently
opened and closed, and which also has impressed upon it
an alternating current of such a nature as to produce the familiar
"buzz-buzz" in a telephone receiver. The opening and closing of
this circuit causes the calling supervisory lamp of the <i>A</i>-operator to
flash at periodic intervals just as if the called subscriber had raised
and lowered his receiver, but more regularly. This is the indication
to the <i>A</i>-operator that the line called for is busy. The buzzing
sound is repeated back through the cord circuit of the <i>A</i>-operator
to the calling subscriber and is a notification to him that the line is
busy.</p>

<p>Sometimes, as is practiced in New York City, for instance, the
buzzing feature is omitted, and the only indication that the calling
subscriber receives that the called-for line is busy is being told so by
the <i>A</i>-operator. This may be considered a special feature and it is
employed in New York because there the custom exists of telling a
calling subscriber, when the line he has called for has been found
busy, that the party will be secured for him and that he, the calling
subscriber, will be called, if he desires.</p>

<p>A modification of this busy-back feature that has been employed
in Boston, and perhaps in other places, is to associate with the busy-back
jack at the <i>B</i>-operator's position a phonograph which, like a
parrot, keeps repeating "Line busy&mdash;please call again." Where
this is done the calling subscriber, <i>if he understands what the phonograph
says</i>, is supposed to hang up his receiver, at which time the
<i>A</i>-operator takes down the connection and the <i>B</i>-operator follows
in response to the notification of her supervisory lamp. The phonograph
busy-back scheme, while ingenious, has not been a success and
has generally been abandoned.</p>

<p>As a rule the independent operating companies in this country
have not employed automatic ringing, and in this case the <i>B</i>-operators
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Page 116]</a></span>have been required to operate their ringing keys and to watch
for the response of the called subscriber. In order to arrange for
this, another supervisory lamp, termed the <i>ringing lamp</i>, is associated
with each incoming trunk plug, the going out of this lamp being a
notification to the <i>B</i>-operator to discontinue ringing.</p>

<p><b>Western Electric Trunk Circuits.</b> The principles involved
in inter-office trunking with automatic ringing, are well illustrated
in the trunk circuit employed by the Western Electric Company in
connection with its No. 1 relay boards. The dotted dividing line
through the center of Fig. 371 represents the separating space between
two offices. The calling subscriber's line in the first office is
shown at the extreme left and the called subscriber's line in the second
office is shown at the extreme right. Both of these lines are standard
multiple switchboard lines of the form already discussed. The
equipment illustrated in the first office is that of an <i>A</i>-board, the
cord circuit shown being that of the regular <i>A</i>-operator. The
outgoing trunk jacks connecting with the trunk leading to the other
office are, it will be understood, multipled through the <i>A</i>-sections
of the board and contain no relay equipment, but the test rings are
connected to ground through a resistance coil <i>1</i>, which takes the
place of the cut-off relay winding of a regular line so far as test conditions
and supervisory relay operation are concerned. The equipment
illustrated in the second office is that of a <i>B</i>-board, it being
understood that the called subscriber's line is multipled through
both the <i>A</i>- and <i>B</i>-boards at that office. The part of the equipment
that is at this point unfamiliar to the reader is, therefore, the cord
circuit at the <i>B</i>-operator's board. This includes, broadly speaking,
the means: (1) for furnishing battery current to the called subscriber;
(2) for accomplishing the ringing of the called subscriber and for
automatically stopping the ringing when he shall respond; (3) for
performing the ordinary switching functions in connection with the
relays of the called subscriber's line in just the same way that an <i>A</i>-operator's
cord carries out these functions; and (4) for causing the
operation of the calling supervisory relay of the <i>A</i>-operator's cord
circuit in just the same manner, under control of the connected called
subscriber, as if that subscriber's line had been connected directly
to the <i>A</i>-operator's cord circuit.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 371. Inter-Office Connection&mdash;Western Electric System</b><br />
<a href="images/fig371.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The operation of these devices in the <i>B</i>-operator's cord circuit
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Page 118]</a></span>may be best understood by following the establishment of the connection.
Assuming that the calling subscriber in the first office
desires a connection with the subscriber's line shown in the second
office, and that the <i>A</i>-operator at the first office has answered the call,
she will then communicate by order wire with the <i>B</i>-operator at the
second office, stating the number of the called subscriber and receiving
from that operator in return the number of the trunk to be employed.
The two operators will then proceed simultaneously to establish
the connection, the <i>A</i>-operator inserting the calling plug into the
outgoing trunk jack, and the <i>B</i>-operator inserting the trunk plug
into the multiple jack of the called subscriber's line after testing.
We will assume at first that the called subscriber's line is found idle
and that both of the operators complete their respective portions of
the work at the same time and we will consider first the condition
of the calling supervisory relay at the <i>A</i>-operator's position.</p>

<p>The circuit of the calling supervisory lamp will have been closed
through the resistance coil <i>1</i> connected with the outgoing trunk
jacks and the lamp will be lighted because, as will be shown, it is
not yet shunted out by the operation of its associated supervisory
relay. Tracing the circuit of the calling supervisory relay of the
<i>A</i>-operator's circuit, it will be found to pass from the live side of the
battery to the ring side of the trunk circuit through one winding of the
repeating coil of the <i>B</i>-operator's cord; beyond this the circuit is
open, since no path exists through the condenser <i>2</i> bridged across
the trunk circuit or through the normally open contacts of the relay
<i>3</i> connected in the talking circuit of the trunk. The association of
this relay <i>3</i> with the repeating coil and the battery of the trunk is
seen to be just the same as that of a supervisory relay in the <i>A</i>-operator's
cord, and it is clear, therefore, that this relay <i>3</i> will not be
energized until the called subscriber has responded. When it is
energized it will complete the path to ground through the <i>A</i>-operator's
calling supervisory relay and operate to shunt out the <i>A</i>-operator's
calling supervisory lamp in just the same manner as if the <i>A</i>-operator's
calling plug had been connected directly with the line of the
calling subscriber. In other words, the called subscriber in the
second office controls the relay <i>3</i>, which, in turn, controls the calling
supervisory relay of the <i>A</i>-operator, which, in turn, shunts out its
lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Page 119]</a></span></p><p>The connection being completed between the two subscribers,
the <i>B</i>-operator depresses one or the other of the ringing keys <i>5</i> or <i>6</i>,
according to which party on the line is called, assuming that it is a
two-party line. It will be noticed that the springs of these ringing
keys are not serially arranged in the talking circuit, but the cutting
off of the trunk circuit back of the ringing keys is accomplished
by the set of springs shown just at the left of the ringing keys, which
set of springs <i>7</i> is operated whenever either one of the ringing keys
is depressed. An auxiliary pair of contacts, shown just below
the group of springs <i>7</i>, is also operated mechanically whenever
either one of the ringing keys is depressed, and this serves to
close one of two normally open points in the circuit of the ringing-key
holding magnet <i>8</i>. This holding magnet <i>8</i> is so arranged with
respect to the contacts of the ringing key that whenever any one of
them is depressed by the operator, it will be held depressed as long
as the magnet is energized just the same as if the operator kept her
finger on the key. The other normally open point in the circuit of
the holding magnet <i>8</i> is at the lower pair of contacts of the test and
holding relay <i>9</i>. This relay is operated whenever the trunk plug
is inserted in the jack of a called line, regardless of the position
of the subscriber's equipment on that line. The circuit may be
traced from the live side of the battery through the trunk disconnect
lamp <i>4</i>, coil <i>9</i>, sleeve strand of cord, and to ground through
the cut-off relay of the line. The insertion of the trunk plug into
the jack thus leaves the completion of the holding-magnet circuit
dependent only upon the auxiliary contact on the ringing key, and,
therefore, as soon as the operator presses either one of these keys, the
clutch magnet is energized and the key is held down, so that ringing
current continues to flow at regular intervals to the called subscriber's
station.</p>

<p>The ringing current issues from the generator <i>10</i>, but the supply
circuit from it is periodically interrupted by the commutator
<i>11</i> geared to the ringing-machine shaft. This periodically interrupted
ringing current passes to the ringing-key contacts through
the coil of the ringing cut-off relay <i>12</i>, and thence to the subscriber's
line. The ringing current is, however, insufficient to cause the
operation of this relay <i>12</i> as long as the high resistance and impedance
of the subscriber's bell and condenser are in the circuit. It is, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Page 120]</a></span>sufficiently sensitive to be operated by this ringing current
when the subscriber responds and thus substitutes the comparatively
low resistance and impedance path of his talking apparatus for the
previous path through his bell. The pulling up of the ringing cut-off
relay <i>12</i> breaks a third normally closed contact in the circuit of
the holding coil <i>8</i>, de-energizing that coil and releasing the ringing
key, thus cutting off ringing current. There is a third brush on the
commutator <i>11</i> connected with the live side of the central battery,
and this is merely for the purpose of assuring the energizing of the
ringing cut-off relay <i>12</i>, should the subscriber respond during the
interval while the commutator <i>11</i> held the ringing current cut off.
The relay <i>12</i> may thus be energized either from the battery, if the
subscriber responds during a period of silence of his ringer, or from
the generator <i>10</i>, if the subscriber responds during a period while
his bell is sounding; in either case the ringing current will be promptly
cut off by the release of the ringing key.</p>

<p>The trunk operator's "disconnect lamp" is shown at <i>4</i>, and it is
to be remembered that this lamp is lighted only when the <i>A</i>-operator
takes down the connection at her end, and also that this lamp is
entirely out of the control of the subscribers, the conditions which
determine its illumination being dependent on the positions of the
operators' plugs at the two ends of the trunk. With both plugs up,
the lamp <i>4</i> will receive current, but will be shunted to prevent its
illumination. The path over which it receives this current may be
traced from battery through the lamp <i>4</i>, thence through the coil of
the relay <i>9</i> and the cut-off relay of the called subscriber's line. This
current would be sufficient to illuminate the lamp, but the lamp is
shunted by a circuit which may be traced from the live side of battery
through the contact of the relay <i>13</i>, closed at the time, and
through the coil of the trunk cut-off relay coil <i>14</i>. The resistance
of this coil is so proportioned to the other parts of the circuit as to
prevent the illumination of the lamp just exactly as in the case of the
shunting resistances of the lamps in the <i>A</i>-operator's cord. It
will be seen, therefore, that the supply of current to the trunk disconnect
lamp is dependent on the trunk plug being inserted into the
jack of the subscriber's line and that the shunting out of this lamp
is dependent on the energization of the relay <i>13</i>. This relay <i>13</i> is
energized as long as the <i>A</i>-operator's plug is inserted into the outgoing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Page 121]</a></span>trunk jack, the path of the energizing circuit being traced
from the live side of the battery at the second office through the
right-hand winding of this relay, thence over the tip side of the trunk
to ground at the first office. From this it follows that as long as both
plugs are up, the disconnect lamp will receive current but will be
shunted out, and as soon as the <i>A</i>-operator pulls down the connection,
the relay <i>13</i> will be de-energized and will thus remove the shunt
from about the lamp, allowing its illumination. The left-hand winding
of the relay <i>13</i> performs no operating function, but is merely to maintain
the balance of the talking circuit, it being bridged during the
connection from the ring side of the trunk to ground in order to
balance the bridge connection of the right-hand coil from the live
side of battery to the tip side of the trunk circuit.</p>

<p>The relay <i>14</i>, already referred to as forming a shunt for the
trunk disconnect lamp, has for its function the keeping of the talking
circuit through the trunk open until such time as the relay <i>13</i> operates,
this being purely an insurance against unnecessary ringing of
a subscriber in case the <i>A</i>-operator should by mistake plug into the
wrong trunk. It is not, therefore, until the <i>A</i>-operator has plugged
into the trunk and the relay <i>13</i> has been operated to cause the
energization of the relay <i>14</i> that the ringing of the called subscriber
can occur, regardless of what the <i>B</i>-operator may have done.</p>

<p>The relay <i>9</i> has an additional function to that of helping to control
the circuit of the ringing-key holding magnet. This is the
holding of the test circuit complete until the operator has tested and
made a connection and then automatically opening it. The test
circuit of the <i>B</i>-operator's trunk may be traced, at the time of testing,
from the thimble of the multiple jack under test, through the tip of
the cord, thence through the uppermost pair of contacts of the relay
<i>9</i> to ground through a winding of the <i>B</i>-operator's induction coil.
After the test has been made and the plug inserted, the relay <i>9</i>,
which is operated by the insertion of the plug, acts to open this
test circuit and at the same time complete the tip side of the cord
circuit.</p>

<p>In the upper portion of Fig. 371 the order-wire connections, by
which the <i>A</i>-operator and the <i>B</i>-operator communicate, are indicated.
It must be remembered in connection with these that the
<i>A</i>-operator only has control of this connection, the <i>B</i>-operator
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Page 122]</a></span>being compelled necessarily to hear whatever the <i>A</i>-operators
have to say when the <i>A</i>-operators come in on the circuit.</p>

<br /><b>Fig. 372. Incoming Trunk Circuit</b><br />
<a href="images/fig372.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The incoming trunk circuit employed by the Western Electric
Company for four-party line ringing is shown in Fig. 372, it being
necessarily somewhat modified from that shown in Fig. 371, which
is adapted for two-party line ringing only. In addition to the provision
of the four-party line ringing keys, by which positive or negative
pulsating current is received over either limb of the line, and to
the provision of the regular alternating current ringing key for
ringing on single party lines, it is necessary in the ringing cut-off
relay to provide for keeping the alternating and the pulsating ringing
currents entirely separate. For this reason, the ringing cut-off
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Page 123]</a></span>relay <i>12</i> is provided with two windings, that at the right being
in the path of the alternating ringing currents that are supplied
to the alternating current key, and that at the left being in the
ground return path for all of the pulsating ringing currents supplied
to the pulsating keys. With this explanation it is believed that this
circuit will be understood from what has been said in connection with
Fig. 371. The operation of the holding coil <i>8</i> is the same in each
case, the holding magnet in Fig. 372 serving to hold depressed any
one of the five ringing keys that may have been used in calling the
subscriber.</p>

<p>The standard four-party line, trunk ringing key of the Western

operate not by pressure but rather by being pulled by the finger of
the operator in such a way as to subject the key shaft to a twisting

shown in the figure and extends along the full length of the set of

<p>The standard trunk relays employed by the Western Electric
Company in connection with the circuits just described are shown
in Figs. 374 and 375. In each case the dust-cap or shield is also
shown. The relay of Fig. 374 is similar to the regular cut-off relay
and is the one used for relays <i>9</i> and <i>14</i> of Figs. 371 and 372. The
relay of Fig. 375 is somewhat similar to the subscriber's line relay
in that it has a tilting armature, and is the one used at <i>13</i> in
Figs. 371 and 372. The trunk relay <i>3</i> in Figs. 371 and 372 is the
same as the <i>A</i>-operator's supervisory relays already discussed.</p>

<p>It has been stated that under certain circumstances <i>B</i>-operator's
trunk circuits devoid of ringing keys, and consequently of all keys,
may be employed. This, so far as the practice of the Bell companies
is concerned, is true only in offices where there are no party lines,
or where, as in many of the Chicago offices, the party lines are
worked on the "jack per station" basis. In "jack per station"
working, the selection of the station on a party line is determined
by the jack on which the plug is put, rather than by a ringing key,
and hence the keyless trunk may be employed.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig376_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 376. Keyless Trunk</b><br />
<a href="images/fig376.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>A keyless trunk as used in New York is shown in Fig. 376.
This has no manually operated keys whatever, and the relay <i>17</i>,
when it is operated, establishes connection between the ringing
generator and the conductors of the trunk plug. The relays <i>3</i>, <i>13</i>,
and <i>12</i> operate in a manner identical with those bearing corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Page 125]</a></span>numbers in Fig. 371. As soon as the trunk operator plugs
into the multiple jack of the called subscriber, the relay <i>16</i> will operate
for the same reason that the relay <i>9</i> operated in connection
with Fig. 371. The trunk disconnect lamp will receive current,
but if the operator has already established connection with the other
end of the trunk, this lamp will not be lighted because shunted by the
relay <i>17</i>, due to the pulling up of the armature of the relay <i>13</i>.
The relay <i>15</i> plays no part in the operation so far described, because
of the fact that its winding is short-circuited by its own contacts and
those of relay <i>12</i>, when the latter is not energized. As a result of
the operation of the relay <i>17</i>, ringing current is sent to line, the supply
circuit including the coil of the relay <i>12</i>. As soon as the subscriber
responds to this ringing current, the armature of the relay <i>12</i>
is pulled up, thus breaking the shunt about the relay <i>15</i>, which, therefore,
starts to operate in series with the relay <i>17</i>, but as its armatures
assume their attracted position, the relay <i>17</i> is cut out of the circuit,
the coil of the relay <i>15</i> being substituted for that of the relay <i>17</i> in the
shunt path around the lamp <i>4</i>. The relay <i>17</i> falls back and cuts off
the ringing current. The relay <i>15</i> now occupies the place with respect
to the shunt around the lamp <i>4</i> that the relay <i>17</i> formerly did,
the continuity of this shunt being determined by the energization of the
relay <i>13</i>. When the <i>A</i>-operator at the distant exchange withdraws
the calling plug from the trunk jack, this relay <i>13</i> becomes de-energized,
breaking the shunt about the lamp <i>4</i> and permitting the display
of that lamp as a signal to the operator to take down the connection.
It may be asked why the falling back of relay <i>15</i> will not
again energize relay <i>17</i> and thus cause a false ring on the called
subscriber. This will not occur because both the relays <i>15</i> and <i>17</i>
depend for their energization on the closure of the contacts of the relay
<i>13</i>, and when this falls back the relay <i>17</i> cannot again be
energized even though the relay <i>15</i> assumes its normal position.</p>

<p><b>Kellogg Trunk Circuits.</b> The provision for proper working of
trunk circuits in connection with the two-wire multiple switchboards
is not an altogether easy matter, owing particularly to the smaller
number of wires available in the plug circuits. It has been worked out
in a highly ingenious way, however, by the Kellogg Company, and a
diagram of their incoming trunk circuit, together with the associated
circuits involved in an inter-office connection, is shown in Fig. 377.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Page 127]</a></span></p><p>This figure illustrates a connection from a regular two-wire
multiple subscriber's line in one office, through an <i>A</i>-operator's
cord circuit there, to the outgoing trunk jacks at that office, thence
through the incoming trunk circuit at the other office to the regular
two-wire multiple subscriber's line at that second office. The portion
of this diagram to be particularly considered is that of the <i>B</i>-operator's
cord circuit. The trunk circuit terminates in the multipled
outgoing trunk jacks at the first office, the trunk extending between
offices consisting, of course, of but two wires. We will first consider
the control of the calling supervisory lamp in the <i>A</i>-operator's cord
circuit, it being remembered that this control must be from the called
subscriber's station. It will be noticed that the left-hand armature of
the relay <i>1</i> serves normally to bridge the winding of relay <i>2</i> across the
cord circuit around the condenser <i>3</i>. When, however, the relay <i>1</i> pulls
up, the coil of relay <i>4</i> is substituted in this bridge connection across
the trunk. The relay <i>2</i> has a very high resistance winding&mdash;about
15,000 ohms&mdash;and this resistance is so great that the tip supervisory
relay of the <i>A</i>-operator's cord will not pull up through it. As a result,
when this relay is bridged across the trunk circuit, the tip relay
on the calling side of the <i>A</i>-operator's cord circuit is de-energized,
just as if the trunk circuit were open, and this results in the lighting
of the <i>A</i>-operator's calling supervisory lamp. The winding of the
relay <i>4</i>, however, is of low resistance&mdash;about 50 ohms&mdash;and when
this is substituted for the high-resistance winding of the relay <i>2</i>, the
tip relay on the calling side of the <i>A</i>-operator's cord is energized,
resulting in the extinguishing of the calling supervisory lamp. The
illumination of the <i>A</i>-operator's calling supervisory lamp depends,
therefore, on whether the high-resistance relay <i>2</i>, or the low-resistance
relay <i>4</i>, is bridged across the trunk, and this depends on whether the
relay <i>1</i> is energized or not. The relay <i>1</i>, being bridged from the tip
side of the trunk circuit to ground and serving as the means of supply
of battery current to the called subscriber, is operated whenever
the called subscriber's receiver is removed from its hook. Therefore,
the called subscriber's hook controls the operation of this relay
<i>1</i>, which, in turn, controls the conditions which cause the illumination
or darkness of the calling supervisory lamp at the distant office.</p>

<p>Assuming that the <i>A</i>-operator has received and answered a call,
and has communicated with the <i>B</i>-operator, telling her the number
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Page 128]</a></span>of the called subscriber, and has received, in turn, the number of
the trunk to be used, and that both operators have put up the connection,
then it will be clear from what has been said that the calling
supervisory lamp of the <i>A</i>-operator will be lighted until the called
subscriber removes his receiver from its hook, because the tip relay
in the <i>A</i>-operator's cord circuit will not pull up through the 15,000-ohm
resistance winding of the relay <i>2</i>. As soon as the subscriber
responds, however, the relay <i>1</i> will be operated by the current which
supplies his transmitter. This will substitute the low-resistance
winding of the relay <i>4</i> for the high-resistance winding of the relay
<i>2</i>, and this will permit the energizing of the tip supervisory relay
of the <i>A</i>-operator and put out the calling supervisory lamp at her
position. As in the Western Electric circuit, therefore, the control
of the <i>A</i>-operator's calling supervisory lamp is from the called
subscriber's station and is relayed back over the trunk to the originating
office.</p>

<p>In this circuit, manual instead of automatic ringing is employed,
therefore, unlike the Western Electric circuit, means must be provided
for notifying the B-operator when the calling subscriber has
answered. This is done by placing at the <i>B</i>-operator's position a
ringing lamp associated with each trunk cord, which is illuminated
when the <i>B</i>-operator places the plug of the incoming trunk into the
multiple jack of the subscriber's line, and remains illuminated until
the subscriber has answered. This is accomplished in the following
manner: when the operator plugs into the jack of the line called, relay
<i>5</i> is energized but is immediately de-energized by the disconnecting
of the circuit of this relay from the sleeve conductor of the cord
when the ringing key is depressed, the selection of the ringing key
being determined by the particular party on the line desired. These
ringing keys have associated with them a set of springs <i>9</i>, which
springs are operated when any one of the ringing keys is depressed.
Thus, with a ringing key depressed and the relay <i>5</i> de-energized,
the ringing lamp will be illuminated by means of a circuit as follows:
from the live side of the battery, through the ringing lamp <i>12</i>,
through the back contact and armature of the relay <i>6</i>, through the
armature and contact of relay <i>4</i>, then through the armature and
front contact of relay <i>2</i>&mdash;which at this time is the relay bridged
across the trunk and, therefore, energized&mdash;and thence through the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Page 129]</a></span>back contact and armature of relay <i>5</i> to ground. When the subscriber
removes his receiver from the hook, the relay <i>1</i> will become
energized as previously described, and will, therefore, operate relay
<i>6</i> to break the circuit of the ringing lamp. The circuit thus established
by the operation of relay <i>1</i> is as follows: from the live side of
battery, through the winding of relay <i>6</i>, through the armature and
contact of relay <i>1</i>, through the armature and contact of relay <i>4</i>,
through the armature and front contact of relay <i>2</i>, thence through
the armature and back contact of relay <i>5</i> to ground. As soon as the
<i>B</i>-operator notes that the ringing lamp has gone out, she knows that
no further ringing is required on that line, thus allowing the operation
of relay <i>5</i> and accomplishing the locking out of the ringing lamp
during the remainder of that connection. The relay <i>6</i>, after having
once pulled up, remains locked up through the rear contact of the
left-hand armature of relay <i>5</i> and ground, until the plug is removed
from the jack.</p>

<p>At the end of the conversation, when the <i>A</i>-operator has disconnected
her cord circuit on the illumination of the supervisory
signals, both relays <i>2</i> and <i>4</i> will be in an unoperated condition and
will provide a circuit for illuminating the disconnect lamp associated
with the <i>B</i>-operator's cord. This circuit may be traced as
follows: from battery through the disconnect lamp, through the
armatures and contacts of relays <i>2</i> and <i>4</i>, thence through the front
contact and armature of relay <i>5</i> to ground, thus illuminating the
disconnect lamp. The ringing lamp will not be re-illuminated at this
time, due to the fact that it has been previously locked out by relay
<i>6</i>. The operator then removes the plug from the jack of the line
called, and the apparatus in the trunk circuit is restored to normal
condition.</p>

<p>In the circuit shown only keys are provided for ringing two parties.
This circuit, however, is not confined to the use of two-party
lines, but may be extended to four parties by simply duplicating the
ringing keys and by connecting them with the proper current for
selectively ringing the other stations.</p>

<p>The method of determining as to whether the called line is free
or busy is similar to that previously described for the <i>A</i>-operator's
cord circuit when making a local connection, and differs only in the
fact that in the case of the trunk cord the test circuit is controlled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Page 130]</a></span>through the contacts of a relay, whereas in the case of the <i>A</i>-operator's
cord, the test circuit was controlled through the contacts of the listening
key. The function of the resistance <i>10</i> and the battery connected
thereto is the same as has been previously described.</p>

<p>The general make-up of trunking switchboard sections is not
greatly different from that of the ordinary switchboard sections where
no trunking is involved. In small exchanges where ring-down
trunks are employed, the trunk line equipment is merely added to
the regular jack and drop equipment of the switchboard. In common-battery
multiple switchboards the <i>A</i>-boards differ in no respect
from the standard single office multiple boards, except that immediately
above the answering jacks and below the multiple there are
arranged in suitable numbers the jacks of the outgoing trunks.</p>

<p>Where the offices are comparatively small, the incoming trunk
portions of the <i>B</i>-boards are usually merely a continuance of the <i>A</i>-boards,
the subscriber's multiple being continuous with and differing
in no respect from that on the <i>A</i>-sections. Instead of the usual pairs
of <i>A</i>-operators' plugs, cords, and supervisory equipment, there are
on the key and plug shelves of these <i>B</i>-sections the incoming trunk
plugs and their associated equipment.</p>

<p>In large offices it is customary to make the <i>B</i>-board entirely
separate from the <i>A</i>-board, although the general characteristics of
construction remain the same. The reason for separate <i>A</i>- and <i>B</i>-switchboards
in large exchanges is to provide for independent growth
of each without the growth of either interfering with the other.</p>

<p>A portion of an incoming trunk, or <i>B</i>-board, is shown in Fig.
378. The multiple is as usual, and, of course, there are no outgoing
trunk jacks nor regular cord pairs. Instead the key and plug
shelves are provided with the incoming-trunk plug equipments,
thirty of these being about the usual quota assigned to each operator's
position.</p>

<p>In multi-office exchanges, employing many central offices,
such, for instance, as those in New York or Chicago, it is frequently
found that nearly all of the calls that originate in one office are for
subscribers whose lines terminate in some other office. In other
words, the number of calls that have to be trunked to other offices
is greatly in excess of the number of calls that may be handled
through the multiple of the <i>A</i>-board in which they originate. It is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Page 133]</a></span>not infrequent to have the percentage of trunked calls run as high as
75 per cent of the total number of calls originating in any one office,
and in some of the offices in the larger cities this percentage runs
higher than 90 per cent.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 379. Section of Partial Multiple Switchboard</b><br />
<a href="images/fig379.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>This fact has brought up for consideration the problem as to
whether, when the nature of the traffic is such that only a very small
portion of the calls can be handled in the office where they originate,
it is worth while to employ the multiple terminals for the subscribers'
lines on the <i>A</i>-boards. In other words, if so great a proportion as
90 per cent of the calls have to be trunked any way, is it worth while
to provide the great expense of a full multiple on all the sections of
the <i>A</i>-board in order to make it possible to handle the remaining
10 per cent of the calls directly by the <i>A</i>-operators?</p>

<p>As a result of this consideration it has been generally conceded
that where such a very great percentage of trunking was necessary,
the full multiple of the subscribers' lines on each section was not
warranted, and what is known as the partial multiple board has
come into existence in large manual exchanges. In these the regular
subscribers' multiple is entirely omitted from the <i>A</i>-board, all
subscribers' calls being handled through outgoing trunk jacks connected
by trunks to <i>B</i>-boards in the same as well as other offices.
In these partial multiple <i>A</i>-boards, the answering jacks are multipled
a few times, usually twice, so that calls on each line may be
answered from more than one position. This multipling of answering
jacks does not in any way take the place of the regular multipling
in full multiple boards, since in no case are the calls completed
through the multiple jacks. It is done merely for the purpose of
contributing to team work between the operators.</p>

<p>A portion of such a partial multiple <i>A</i>-board is shown in Fig.
379. This view shows slightly more than one section, and the regular
answering jacks and lamps may be seen at the bottom of the
jack space just above the plugs. Above these are placed the outgoing
trunk jacks, those that are in use being indicated with white
designation strips. Above the outgoing trunk jacks are placed the
multiples of the answering jacks, these not being provided with
lamps.</p>

<p>The partial multiple <i>A</i>-section of Fig. 379 is a portion of the
switchboard equipment of the same office to which the trunking section
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Page 134]</a></span>shown in Fig. 378 belongs. That this is a large multiple board
may be gathered from the number of multiple jacks in the trunking
section, 8,400 being installed with room for 10,500. That the board
is a portion of an equipment belonging to an exchange of enormous
proportions may be gathered from the number of outgoing trunk
jacks shown in the <i>A</i>-board, and in the great number of order-wire
keys shown between each of the sets of regular cord-circuit keys.
The switchboards illustrated in these two figures are those of one of
the large offices of the New York Telephone Company on Manhattan
Island, and the photographs were taken especially for this work
by the Western Electric Company.</p>

<blockquote><p><b>Cable Color Code.</b> A great part of the wiring of switchboards requires
to be done with insulated wires grouped into cables. In the wiring of manual
switchboards as described in the seven preceding chapters, and of automatic
and automanual systems and of private branch-exchange and intercommunicating
systems described in succeeding chapters, cables formed as follows are
widely used:</p>

<p>Tinned soft copper wires, usually of No. 22 or No. 24 B. &amp; S. gauge, are
insulated, first with two coverings of silk, then with one covering of cotton.
The outer (cotton) insulation of each wire is made of white or of dyed threads.
If dyed, the color either is solid red, black, blue, orange, green, brown, or
slate, or it is striped, by combining one of those colors with white or a remaining
color. The object of coloring the wires is to enable them to be identified by
sight instead of by electrical testing.</p>

<p>Wires so insulated are twisted into pairs, choosing the colors of the
"line" and "mate" according to a predetermined plan. An assortment of these
pairs then is laid up spirally to form the cable core, over which are placed
certain wrappings and an outer braid. A widely used form of switchboard
cable has paper and lead foil wrappings over the core, and the outer cotton
braid finally is treated with a fire-resisting paint.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVIII" id="CHAPTER_XXVIII"></a>CHAPTER XXVIII<br />

<span style="font-size:80%;">FUNDAMENTAL CONSIDERATIONS OF AUTOMATIC SYSTEMS</span></h2>


<p><b>Definition.</b> The term automatic, as applied to telephone
systems, has come to refer to those systems in which machines at
the central office, under the guidance of the subscribers, do the work
that is done by operators in manual systems. In all automatic
telephone systems, the work of connecting and disconnecting the
lines, of ringing the called subscriber, even though he must be selected
from among those on a party line, of refusing to connect with
a line that is already in use, and informing the calling subscriber
that such line is busy, of making connections to trunk lines and
through them to lines in other offices and doing the same sort of things
there, of counting and recording the successful calls made by a subscriber,
rejecting the unsuccessful, and nearly all the thousand and
one other acts necessary in telephone service, are performed without
the presence of any guiding intelligence at the central office.</p>

<p>The fundamental object of the automatic system is to do away
with the central-office operator. In order that each subscriber may
control the making of his own connections there is added to his station
equipment a call transmitting device by the manipulation of which
he causes the central-office mechanisms to establish the connections
he desires.</p>

<p>We think that the automatic system is one of the most astonishing
developments of human ingenuity. The workers in this development
are worthy of particular notice. From occupying a position
in popular regard in common with long-haired men and short-haired
women they have recently appeared as sane, reasonable men with the
courage of their convictions and, better yet, with the ability to make
their convictions come true. The scoffers have remained to pray.</p>

<p><b>Arguments Against Automatic Idea.</b> Naturally there has been
a bitter fight against the automatic. Those who have opposed it
have contended:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Page 136]</a></span></p><p>First: that it is too complicated and, therefore, could be neither
reliable or economical.</p>

<p>Second: that it is too expensive, and that the necessary first cost
could not be justified.</p>

<p>Third: that it is too inflexible and could not adapt itself to
special kinds of service.</p>

<p>Fourth: that it is all wrong from the subscribers' point of view
as the public will not tolerate "doing its own operating."</p>

<p><i>Complexity.</i> This first objection as to complexity, and consequent
alleged unreliability and lack of economy should be carefully
analyzed. It too often happens that a new invention is cast
into outer darkness by those whose opinions carry weight by such
words as "it cannot work; it is too complicated." Fortunately for the
world, the patience and fortitude which men must possess before
they can produce meritorious, though intricate inventions, are usually
sufficient to prevent their being crushed by any such offhand
condemnation, and the test of time and service is allowed to become
the real criterion.</p>

<p>It would be difficult to find an art that has gone forward as
rapidly as telephony. Within its short life of a little over thirty
years it has grown from the phase of trifling with a mere toy to an
affair of momentous importance to civilization. There has been a
tendency, particularly marked during recent years, toward greater
complexity; and probably every complicated new system or piece
of apparatus has been roundly condemned, by those versed in the
art as it was, as being unable to survive on account of its complication.</p>

<p>To illustrate: A prominent telephone man, in arguing against
the nickel-in-the-slot method of charging for telephone service once
said, partly in jest, "The Lord never intended telephone service to
be given in that way." This, while a little off the point, is akin to
the sweeping aside of new telephone systems on the sole ground that
they are complicated. These are not real reasons, but rather convenient
ways of disposing of vexing problems with a minimum amount
of labor. Important questions lying at the very root of the development
of a great industry may not be put aside permanently in this
offhand way. The Lord has never, so far as we know, indicated
just what his intentions were in the matter of nickel service; and no
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Page 137]</a></span>one has ever shown yet just what degree of complexity will prevent
a telephone system from working.</p>

<p>It is safe to say that, if other things are equal, the simpler a machine
is, the better; but simplicity, though desirable, is not all-important.
Complexity is warranted if it can show enough advantages.</p>

<p>If one takes a narrow view of the development of things mechanical
and electrical, he will say that the trend is toward simplicity.
The mechanic in designing a machine to perform certain functions tries
to make it as simple as possible. He designs and re-designs, making
one part do the work of two and contriving schemes for reducing
the complexity of action and form of each remaining part. His whole
trend is away from complication, and this is as it should be. Other
things being equal, the simpler the better. A broad view, however,
will show that the arts are becoming more and more complicated.
Take the implements of the art of writing: The typewriter is vastly
more complicated than the pen, whether of steel or quill, yet most
of the writing of today is done on the typewriter, and is done better
and more economically. The art of printing affords even more
striking examples.</p>

<p>In telephony, while every effort has been made to simplify the
component parts of the system, the system itself has ever developed
from the simple toward the complex. The adoption of the multiple
switchboard, of automatic ringing, of selective ringing on party
lines, of measured-service appliances, and of automatic systems
have all constituted steps in this direction. The adoption of more
complicated devices and systems in telephony has nearly always
followed a demand for the performance by the machinery of the
system of additional or different functions. As in animal and plant
life, so in mechanics&mdash;the higher the organism functionally the more
complex it becomes physically.</p>

<p>Greater intricacy in apparatus and in methods is warranted when
it is found desirable to make the machine perform added functions.
Once the functions are determined upon, then the whole trend of
the development of the machine for carrying them out should be
toward simplicity. When the machine has reached its highest stage
of development some one proposes that it be required to do something
that has hitherto been done manually, or by a separate machine,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Page 138]</a></span>or not at all. With this added function a vast added complication
may come, after which, if it develops that the new function may with
economy be performed by the machine, the process of simplification
again begins, the whole design finally taking on an indefinable elegance
which appears only when each part is so made as to be best
adapted in composition, form, and strength to the work it is to perform.</p>

<p>Achievements in the past teach us that a machine may be made
to do almost anything automatically if only the time, patience, skill,
and money be brought to bear. This is also true of a telephone system.
The primal question to decide is, what functions the system is to
perform within itself, automatically, and what is to be done manually
or with manual aid. Sometimes great complications are brought
into the system in an attempt to do something which may very easily
and cheaply be done by hand. Cases might be pointed out in which
fortunes and life-works have been wasted in perfecting machines
for which there was no real economic need. It is needless to cite
cases where the reverse is true. The matter of wisely choosing the
functions of the system is of fundamental importance. In choosing
these the question of complication is only one of many factors to be
considered.</p>

<p>One of the strongest arguments against intricacy in telephone
apparatus is its greater initial cost, its greater cost of maintenance,
and its liability to get out of order. Greater complexity of apparatus
usually means greater first cost, but it does not necessarily mean
greater cost of up-keep or lessened reliability. A dollar watch is
more simple than an expensive one. The one, however, does its
work passably and is thrown away in a year or so; the other does
its work marvelously well and may last generations, being handed
down from father to son. Merely reducing the number of parts
in a machine does not necessarily mean greater reliability. Frequently
the attempt to make one part do several diverse things results
in such a sacrifice in the simplicity of action of that part as to
cause undue strain, or wear, or unreliable action. Better results may
be attained by adding parts, so that each may have a comparatively
simple thing to do.</p>

<p>The stage of development of an art is a factor in determining the
degree of complexity that may be allowed in the machinery of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Page 139]</a></span>art. A linotype machine, if constructed by miracle several hundred
years ago, would have been of no value to the printer's art then.
The skill was not available to operate and maintain it, nor was the
need of the public sufficiently developed to make it of use. Similarly
the automatic telephone exchange would have been of little
value thirty years ago. The knowledge of telephone men was not
sufficiently developed to maintain it, telephone users were not sufficiently
numerous to warrant it, and the public was not sufficiently
trained to use it. Industries, like human beings, must learn to creep
before they can walk.</p>

<p>Another factor which must be considered in determining the
allowable degree of complexity in a telephone system is the character
of the labor available to care for and manage it. Usually the conditions
which make for unskilled labor also lend themselves to the use of
comparatively simple systems. Thus, in a small village remote from
large cities the complexity inherent in a common-battery multiple
switchboard would be objectionable. The village would probably
not afford a man adequately skilled to care for it, and the size of the
exchange would not warrant the expense of keeping such a man.
Fortunately no such switchboard is needed. A far simpler device,
the plain magneto switchboard&mdash;so simple that the girl who manipulates
it may also often care for its troubles&mdash;is admirably adapted
to the purpose. So it is with the automatic telephone system; even
its most enthusiastic advocate would be foolish indeed to contend that
for all places and purposes it was superior to the manual.</p>

<p>These remarks are far from being intended as a plea for complex
telephone apparatus and systems; every device, every machine,
and every system should be of the simplest possible nature consistent
with the functions it has to perform. They are rather a protest
against the broadcast condemnation of complex apparatus and systems
just because they are complicated, and without regard to other
factors. Such condemnation is detrimental to the progress of telephony.
Where would the printing art be today if the linotype, the
cylinder press, and other modern printing machinery of marvelous
intricacy had been put aside on account of the fact that they were
more complicated than the printing machinery of our forefathers?</p>

<p>That the automatic telephone system is complex, exceedingly
complex, cannot be denied, but experience has amply proven that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Page 140]</a></span>its complexity does not prevent it from giving reliable service, nor
from being maintained at a reasonable cost.</p>

<p><i>Expense.</i> The second argument against the automatic&mdash;that
it is too expensive&mdash;is one that must be analyzed before it means
anything. It is true that for small and medium-sized exchanges the
total first cost of the central office and subscribers' station equipment,
is greater than that for manual exchanges of corresponding sizes.
The prices at which various sizes of automatic exchange equipments
may be purchased vary, however, almost in direct proportion to
the number of lines, whereas in manual equipment the price per line
increases very rapidly as the number of lines increases. From
this it follows that for very large exchanges the cost of automatic
apparatus becomes as low, and may be even lower than for manual.
Roughly speaking the cost of telephones and central-office equipment
for small exchanges is about twice as great for automatic as for
manual, and for very large exchanges, of about 10,000 lines, the
cost of the two for switchboards and telephones is about equal.</p>

<p>For all except the largest exchanges, therefore, the greater first
cost of automatic apparatus must be put down as one of the factors
to be weighed in making the choice between automatic and manual,
this factor being less and less objectionable as the size of the equipment
increases and finally disappearing altogether for very large
equipments. Greater first cost is, of course, warranted if the fixed
charges on the greater investment are more than offset by the economy
resulting. The automatic screw machine, for instance, costs
many times more than the hand screw machine, but it has largely displaced
the hand machine nevertheless.</p>

<p><i>Flexibility.</i> The third argument against the automatic telephone
system&mdash;its flexibility&mdash;is one that only time and experience has
been able to answer. Enough time has elapsed and enough experience
has been gained, however, to disprove the validity of this argument.
In fact, the great flexibility of the automatic system has
been one of its surprising developments. No sooner has the statement
been made that the automatic system could not do a certain
thing than forthwith it has done it. It was once quite clear that
the automatic system was not practicable for party-line selective
ringing; yet today many automatic systems are working successfully
with this feature; the selection between the parties on a line being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Page 141]</a></span>accomplished with just as great certainty as in manual systems.
Again it has seemed quite obvious that the automatic system could
not hope to cope with the reverting call problem, <i>i. e.</i>, enabling a
subscriber on a party line to call back to reach another subscriber
on the same line; yet today the automatic system may do this in a
way that is perhaps even more satisfactory than the way in which
it is done in multiple manual switchboards. It is true that the automatic
system has not done away with the toll operator and it probably
never will be advantageous to require it to do so for the simple
reason that the work of the toll operator in recording the connections
and in bringing together the subscribers is a matter that requires
not only accuracy but judgment, and the latter, of course, no machine
can supply. It is probable also that the private branch-exchange
operator will survive in automatic systems. This is not because the
automatic system cannot readily perform the switching duties, but
the private branch-exchange operator has other duties than the mere
building up and taking down of connections. She is, as it were, a
door-keeper guarding the telephone door of a business establishment;
like the toll operator she must be possessed of judgment and
of courtesy in large degree, neither of which can be supplied by
machinery.</p>

<p>In respect to toll service and private branch-exchange service
where, as just stated, operators are required on account of the nature
of the service, the automatic system has again shown its adaptability
and flexibility. It has shown its capability of working in harmony
with manual switchboards, of whatever nature, and there is a growing
tendency to apply automatic devices and automatic principles of
operation to manual switchboards, whether toll or private branch
or other kinds, even though the services of an operator are required,
the idea being to do by machinery that portion of the work which a
machine is able to do better or more economically than a human
being.</p>

<p><i>Attitude of Public.</i> The attitude of the public toward the automatic
is one that is still open to discussion; at least there is still much
discussion on it. A few years ago it did seem reasonable to suppose
that the general telephone user would prefer to get his connection by
merely asking for it rather than to make it himself by "spelling" it
out on the dial of his telephone instrument. We have studied this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Page 142]</a></span>point carefully in a good many different communities and it is our
opinion that the public finds no fault with being required to make
its own connections. To our minds it is proven beyond question that
either the method employed in the automatic or that in the manual
system is satisfactory to the public as long as good service results,
and it is beyond question that the public may get this with either.</p>

<p><i>Subscriber's Station Equipment.</i> The added complexity of the
mechanism at the subscriber's station is in our opinion the most
valid objection that can be urged against the automatic system as
it exists today. This objection has, however, been much reduced
by the greater simplicity and greater excellence of material and workmanship
that is employed in the controlling devices in modern automatic
systems. However, the automatic system must always suffer
in comparison with the manual in respect of simplicity of the subscriber's
equipment. The simplest conceivable thing to meet all
of the requirements of telephone service at a subscriber's station is
the modern common-battery manual telephone. The automatic
telephone differs from this only in the addition of the mechanism
for enabling the subscriber to control the central-office apparatus
in the making of calls. From the standpoint of maintenance, simplicity
at the subscriber's station is, of course, to be striven for since
the proper care of complex devices scattered all over a community
is a much more serious matter than where the devices are centered
at one point, as in the central office. Nevertheless, as pointed out,
complexity is not fatal, and it is possible, as has been proven, to so
design and construct the required apparatus in connection with the
subscribers' telephones as to make them subject to an amount of
trouble that is not serious.</p>

<p><b>Comparative Costs.</b> A comparison of the total costs of owning,
operating, and maintaining manual and automatic systems
usually results in favor of the automatic, except in small exchanges.
This seems to be the consensus of opinion among those who have
studied the matter deeply. Although the automatic usually requires
a larger investment, and consequently a larger annual charge
for interest and depreciation, assuming the same rates for each case,
and although the automatic requires a somewhat higher degree of
skill to maintain it and to keep it working properly than the manual,
the elimination of operators or the reduction in their number and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Page 143]</a></span>consequent saving of salaries and contributory expenses together
with other items of saving that will be mentioned serves to throw
the balance in favor of the automatic.</p>

<p>The ease with which the automatic system lends itself to inter-office
trunking makes feasible a greater subdivision of exchange
districts into office districts and particularly makes it economical,
where such would not be warranted in manual working. All this
tends toward a reduction in average length of subscribers' lines and
it seems probable that this possibility will be worked upon in the
future, more than it has been in the past, to effect a considerable
saving in the cost of the wire plant, which is the part of a telephone
plant that shows least and costs most.</p>

<p><b>Automatic vs. Manual.</b> Taking it all in all the question of automatic
versus manual may not and can not be disposed of by a consideration
of any single one of the alleged features of superiority or
inferiority of either. Each must be looked at as a practical way of
giving telephone service, and a decision can be reached only by a
careful weighing of all the factors which contribute to economy,
reliability, and general desirability from the standpoint of the public.
Public sentiment must neither be overlooked nor taken lightly, since,
in the final analysis, it is the public that must be satisfied.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Operation.</b> In all of the automatic telephone systems
that have achieved any success whatever, the selection of the
desired subscriber's line by the calling subscriber is accomplished by
means of step-by-step mechanism at the central office, controlled
by impulses sent or caused to be sent by the acts of the subscriber.</p>

<p><i>Strowger System.</i> In the so-called Strowger system, manufactured
by the Automatic Electric Company of Chicago, the subscriber,
in calling, manipulates a dial by which the central-office
switching mechanism is made to build up the connection he wants.
The dial is moved as many times as there are digits in the called
subscriber's number and each movement sends a series of impulses
to the central office corresponding in number respectively to the digits
in the called subscriber's number. During each pause, except the
last one, between these series of impulses, the central-office mechanism
operates to shift the control of the calling subscriber's line from
one set of switching apparatus at the central office to another.</p>

<p>In case a four-digit number is being selected first, the movement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Page 144]</a></span>of the dial by the calling subscriber will correspond to the
thousands digit of the number being called, and the resulting movement
of the central-office apparatus will continue the calling subscriber's
line through a trunk to a piece of apparatus capable of
further extending his line toward the line terminals of the thousand
subscribers whose numbers begin with the digit chosen. The next
movement of the dial corresponding to the hundreds digit of the
called number will operate this piece of apparatus to again extend
the calling subscriber's line through another trunk to apparatus
representing the particular hundred in which the called subscriber's
number is. The third movement of the dial corresponding to the
tens digit will pick out the group of ten containing the called subscriber's
line, and the fourth movement corresponding to the units
digit will pick out and connect with the particular line called.</p>

<p><i>Lorimer System.</i> In the Lorimer automatic system invented by
the Lorimer Brothers, and now being manufactured by the Canadian
Machine Telephone Company of Toronto, Canada, the subscriber
sets up the number he desires complete by moving four
levers on his telephone so that the desired number appears visibly
before him. He then turns a handle and the central-office apparatus,
under the control of the electrical conditions thus set up by the subscriber,
establishes the connection. In this system, unlike the Strowger
system, the controlling impulses are not caused by the movement
of the subscriber's apparatus in returning to its normal position after
being set by the subscriber. Instead, the conditions established at
the subscriber's station by the subscriber in setting up the desired
number, merely determine the point in the series of impulses corresponding
to each digit at which the stepping impulses local to the
central office shall cease, and in this way the proper number of impulses
in the series corresponding to each digit is determined.</p>

<p><i>Magnet- vs. Power-Driven Switches.</i> These two systems differ
radically in another respect. In the Strowger system it is the electrical
impulses initiated at the subscriber's apparatus that actually cause
the movement of the switching parts at the central office, these impulses
energizing electromagnets which move the central-office
switching devices a step at a time the desired number of steps. In
the Lorimer system the switches are all power-driven and the impulses
under the control of the subscriber's instrument merely serve
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Page 145]</a></span>to control the application of this power to the various switching
mechanisms. These details will be more fully dealt with in subsequent
chapters.</p>

<p><i>Multiple vs. Trunking.</i> It has been shown in the preceding
portion of this work that the tendency in manual switchboard practice
has been away from trunking between the various sections or
positions of a board, and toward the multiple idea of operating,
wherein each operator is able to complete the connection with any
line in the same office without resorting to trunks or to the aid of
other operators. Strangely enough the reverse has been true in the
development of the automatic system. As long as the inventors tried
to follow the most successful practice in manual working, failure
resulted. The automatic systems of today are essentially trunking
systems and while they all involve multiple connections in greater
or less degree, all of them depend fundamentally upon the extending
of the calling line by separate lengths until it finally reaches and
connects with the called line.</p>

<p><i>Grouping of Subscribers.</i> In this connection we wish to point
out here two very essential features without which, so far as we are
aware, no automatic telephone system has been able to operate
successfully. The first of these is the division of the total number of
lines in any office of the exchange into comparatively small groups
and the employment of correspondingly small switch units for each
group. Many of the early automatic systems that were proposed
involved the idea of having each switch capable in itself of making
connection with any line in the entire office. As long as the number
of lines was small&mdash;one hundred or thereabouts&mdash;this might be
all right, but where the lines number in the thousands, it is readily
seen that the switches would be of prohibitive size and cost.</p>

<p><i>Trunking between Groups.</i> This feature made necessary the
employment of trunk connections between groups. By means of
these the lines are extended a step at a time, first entering a large
group of groups, containing the desired subscriber; then entering
the smaller group containing that subscriber; and lastly entering into
connection with the line itself. The carrying out of this idea was
greatly complicated by the necessity of providing for many simultaneous
connections through the switchboard. It was comparatively
easy to accomplish the extension of one line through a series
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Page 146]</a></span>of links or trunks to another line, but it was not so easy to do this
and still leave it possible for any other line to pick out and connect
with any other idle line without interference with the first connection.
A number of parallel paths must be provided for each
possible connection. Groups of trunks are, therefore, provided
instead of single trunks between common points to be connected.
The subscriber who operates his instrument in making a call knows
nothing of this and it is, of course, impossible for him to give any
thought to the matter as to which one of the possible paths he shall
choose. It was by a realization of these facts that the failures of
the past were turned into the successes of the present. The subscriber
by setting his signal transmitter was made to govern the action
of the central-office apparatus in the selection of the proper
<i>group</i> of trunks. The group being selected, the central-office
apparatus was made to act at once <i>automatically</i> to pick out and connect
with <i>the first idle trunk of such group</i>. Thus, we may say <i>that the
subscriber by the act performed on his signal transmitter, voluntarily
chooses the group of trunks, and immediately thereafter the central-office
apparatus without the volition of the subscriber picks out the first
idle one of this group of trunks so chosen</i>. This fundamental idea,
so far as we are aware, underlies all of the successful automatic
telephone-exchange systems. It provides for the possibility of many
simultaneous connections through the switchboard, and it provides
against the simultaneous appropriation of the same path by two
or more calling subscribers and thus assures against interference
in the choice of the paths.</p>

<p><i>Outline of Action.</i> In order to illustrate this point we may
briefly outline the action of the Strowger automatic system in the
making of a connection. Assume that the calling subscriber desires
a connection with a subscriber whose line bears the number 9,567.
The subscriber in making the call will, by the first movement of his
dial, transmit nine impulses over his line. This will cause the selective
apparatus at the central office, that is at the time associated
with the calling subscriber's line, to move its selecting fingers opposite
a group of terminals representing the ends of a group of trunk
lines leading to apparatus employed in connecting with the ninth
thousand of the subscribers' lines.</p>

<p>While the calling subscriber is getting ready to transmit the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Page 147]</a></span>next digit, the automatic apparatus, without his volition, starts to
pick out the first idle one of the group of trunks so chosen. Having
found this it connects with it and the calling subscriber's line is thus
extended to another selective apparatus capable of performing the
same sort of function in choosing the proper hundreds group.</p>

<p>In the next movement of his dial the calling subscriber will
send five impulses. This will cause the last chosen selective switch
to move its selective fingers opposite a group of terminals representing
the ends of a group of trunks each leading to a switch that is
capable of making connection with any one of the lines in the fifth
hundred of the ninth thousand. Again during the pause by the
subscriber, the switch that chose this group of trunks will start automatically
to pick out and connect with the first idle one of them, and
will thus extend the line to a selective switch that is capable of reaching
the desired line, since it has access to all of the lines in the chosen
hundred. The third movement of the dial sends six impulses and
this causes this last chosen switch to move opposite the sixth group
of ten terminals, so that there has now been chosen the nine hundred
and fifty-sixth group of ten lines. The final movement of the dial
sends seven impulses and the last mentioned switch connects with
the seventh line terminal in the group of ten previously chosen and
the connection is complete, assuming that the called line was not
already engaged. If it had been found busy, the final switch would
have been prevented from connecting with it by the electrical condition
of certain of its contacts and the busy signal would have been
transmitted back to the calling subscriber.</p>

<p><i>Fundamental Idea.</i> This idea of subdividing the subscribers'
lines in an automatic exchange, of providing different groups of
trunks so arranged as to afford by combination a number of possible
parallel paths between any two lines, of having the calling subscriber
select, by the manipulation of his instrument, the proper group of
trunks any one of which might be used to establish the connection
he desires, and of having the central-office apparatus act automatically
to choose and connect with an idle one in this chosen group,
should be firmly grasped. It appears, as we have said, in every
successful automatic system capable of serving more than one small
group of lines, and until it was evolved automatic telephony was not
a success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Page 148]</a></span></p><p><i>Testing.</i> As each trunk is chosen and connected with, conditions
are established, by means not unlike the busy test in multiple
manual switchboards, which will guard that trunk and its associated
apparatus against appropriation by any other line or apparatus
as long as it is held in use. Likewise, as soon as any subscriber's
line is put into use, either by virtue of a call being originated on it,
or by virtue of its being connected with as a called line, conditions
are automatically established which guard it against being connected
with any other line as long as it is busy. These guarding conditions
of both trunks and lines, as in the manual board, are established by
making certain contacts, associated with the trunks or lines, assume
a certain electrical condition when busy that is different from their
electrical condition when idle; but unlike the manual switchboard
this different electrical condition does not act to cause a click in
any one's ear, but rather to energize or de-energize certain electromagnets
which will establish or fail to establish the connection according
to whether it is proper or improper to do so.</p>

<p><i>Local and Inter-Office Trunks.</i> The groups of trunks that are
used in building up connections between subscribers' lines may be
local to the central office, or they may extend between different
offices. The action of the two kinds of trunks, local or inter-office,
is broadly the same.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXIX" id="CHAPTER_XXIX"></a>CHAPTER XXIX<br />

<span style="font-size:80%;">THE AUTOMATIC ELECTRIC COMPANY'S SYSTEM</span></h2>


<p>Almost wherever automatic telephony is to be found&mdash;and
its use is extensive and rapidly growing&mdash;the so-called Strowger
system is employed. It is so named because it is the outgrowth of
the work of Almon B. Strowger, an early inventor in the automatic
telephone art. That the system should bear the name of Strowger,
however, gives too great prominence to his work and too little to that
of the engineers of the Automatic Electric Company under the leadership
of Alexander E. Keith.</p>

<p><b>Principles of Selecting Switch.</b> The underlying features of
this automatic system have already been referred to in the abstract.
A better grasp of its principles may, however, be had by considering
a concrete example of its most important piece of apparatus&mdash;the
selecting switch. The bare skeleton of such a switch, sufficient
only to illustrate the salient point in its mode of operation, is shown
in Fig. 380. The essential elements of this are a vertical shaft capable
of both longitudinal and rotary motion; a pawl and ratchet
mechanism actuated by a magnet for moving the shaft vertically
a step at a time; another pawl and ratchet mechanism actuated by
another magnet for rotating the shaft a step at a time; an arm carrying
wiper contacts on its outer end, mounted on and moving with
the shaft; and a bank of contacts arranged on the inner surface of a
section of a cylinder adapted to be engaged by the wiper contacts on
this movable arm.</p>

<p>These various elements are indicated in the merest outline
and with much distortion in Fig. 380, which is intended to illustrate
the principles of operation rather than the details as they actually
are in the system. In the upper left-hand corner of this figure, the
magnet shown will, if energized by impulses of current, attract and
release its armature and, in doing so, cause the pawl controlled by
this magnet to move the vertical shaft of the switch up a step at a time,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Page 150]</a></span>as many steps as there are impulses of current. The vertical movement
of this shaft will carry the wiper arm, attached to the lower end
of the shaft, up the same number of steps and, in doing so, will bring
the contacts of this wiper arm opposite, but not engaging, the corresponding
row of stationary contacts in the semi-cylindrical bank.
Likewise, through the ratchet cylinder on the intermediate portion
of the shaft, the magnet shown at the right-hand portion of this figure
will, when energized by a succession of electrical impulses, rotate
the shaft a step at a time, as many steps as there are impulses.
This will thus cause the contacts of the wiper arm to move over the
successive contacts in the row opposite to which the wiper had been
carried in its vertical movement.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig380_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 380. Principles of Automatic Switch</b><br />
<a href="images/fig380.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>At the lower left-hand corner of this figure, there is shown a
pair of keys either one of which, when operated, will complete the
circuit of the magnet to which it is connected, this circuit including
a common battery. In a certain rough way this pair of key switches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Page 151]</a></span>in the lower left-hand corner of the drawing may be taken as representing
the call-transmitting apparatus at the subscriber's station,
and the two wires extending therefrom may be taken as representing
the line wires connecting that subscriber's station to the central
office; but the student must avoid interpreting them as actual
representations of the subscriber's station calling apparatus or the
subscriber's line since their counterparts are not to be found in the
system as it really exists. Here again accuracy has been sacrificed
for ease in setting forth a feature of operation.</p>

<p>Still referring to Fig. 380, it will be seen that the bank contacts
consist of ten rows, each having ten pairs of contacts. Assume
again, for the sake of simplicity, that the exchange under consideration
has one hundred subscribers and that each pair of bank contacts
represents the terminals of one subscriber's line. Assume
further that the key switches in the lower left-hand corner of the
figure are being manipulated by a subscriber at that station and
that he wishes to obtain a connection with line No. 67. By pressing
and releasing the left-hand key six times, he will cause six separate
impulses of current to flow through the upper left-hand magnet and
this will cause the switch shaft to move up six steps and bring the
wiper arm opposite the sixth row of bank contacts. If he now
presses and releases his right-hand key seven times, he will, through
the action of the right-hand magnet, rotate the shaft seven steps,
thus bringing the wipers into contact with the seventh contact of the
sixth row and thus into contact with the desired line. As the wiper
contacts on the switch arm form the terminals of the calling subscriber's
line, it will be apparent that the calling subscriber is now connected
through his switch with the line of subscriber No. 67.</p>

<p>As stated, each of the pairs of bank contacts are connected with
the line of a subscriber; the line, Fig. 380, is shown so connected to
the forty-first pair of contacts, that is to the first contact in the fourth
row. The selecting switch shown in Fig. 380 would be for the sole
use of the subscriber on the line No. 41. Each of the other subscribers
would have a similar switch for his own exclusive use. Since any
of the switches must be capable of reaching line No. 67, for instance,
when moved <i>up</i> six rows and <i>around</i> seven, it follows that the
sixty-seventh pair of contacts in each bank of the entire one hundred switches
must also be connected together and to line No. 67. The same is,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Page 152]</a></span>of course, true of all the contacts corresponding to any other number.
Multiple connections are thus involved between the corresponding
contacts of the banks, in much the same way as in the corresponding
jacks in the multiple of a manual switchboard. As a result of this
multiple connection of the bank contacts, any subscriber may move
the wiper arm of his selecting switch into connection with the line of
any other subscriber.</p>

<p><i>The "Up-and-Around" Movement.</i> The elemental idea to be
grasped by the discussion so far, is the so-called "up-and-around"
method of action of the selecting switches employed in this system.
This preliminary discussion may be carried a step further
by saying that the arrangement is such that when a subscriber
presses both his keys and grounds both of the limbs of his line,
such a condition is brought about as will cause all holding pawls
to be withdrawn from the shaft, and thus allow it to return to its
normal position with respect to both its vertical and rotary movements.
No attempt has been made in Fig. 380 to show how this is
accomplished.</p>

<p><b>Function of Line Switch.</b> Such a system as has been briefly
outlined in the foregoing would require a separate selecting switch
for each subscriber's line and would be limited to use in exchanges
having not more than one hundred lines. In the modern system of
the Automatic Electric Company, the requirement that each subscriber
shall have a selective switch, individual to his own line,
has been eliminated by introducing what is called an <i>individual
line switch</i> by means of which any one of a group of subscribers'
lines, making a call, automatically appropriates one of a smaller
group of selecting switches and makes it its own only while the connection
exists.</p>

<p><b>Subdivision of Subscribers' Lines.</b> The limitation as to the
size of the exchange has been overcome, without increasing the number
of bank contacts in any selecting switch, by dividing the subscribers'
lines into groups of one hundred and causing selecting
switches automatically to extend the calling subscriber's line first into
a group of groups corresponding, for instance, to the thousand
containing the called subscriber's line, and then into the particular
group containing the line, and lastly, to connect with the individual
line in that group.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Page 153]</a></span></p><p><b>Underlying Feature of Trunking System.</b> It will be remembered
that in the chapter on fundamental principles of automatic systems,
it was stated that the subscriber, by means of the signal transmitter
at his station, was made to govern the action of the central-office
apparatus in the selection of a proper group of trunks; and the group
being selected, the central-office apparatus was made to act automatically
to pick out and connect with the first idle trunk of such
group. This selection by the subscriber of a group followed by
the automatic selection from among that group forms the basis of
the trunking system. It is impossible, by means of any simple
diagram, to show a complete scheme of trunking employed, but
Fig. 381 will give a fundamental conception of it. This figure
shows how a single calling line, indicated at the bottom, may find
access into any particular line in an office having a capacity for ten
thousand.</p>

<p><b>Names of Selecting Switches.</b> Selecting switches of the "up-and-around"
type are the means by which the calling line selects
and connects with the trunk lines required in building up the connection,
and finally selects and connects with the line of the called
subscriber. Where such a switch is employed for the purpose of
selecting a <i>trunk</i>, it is called a selector switch. It is a <i>first selector</i>
when it serves to pick out a major group of lines, <i>i. e.</i>, a group containing
a particular thousand lines or, in a multi-office system, a
group represented by a complete central office. It is a <i>second selector</i>
when it serves to make the next subdivision of groups; a <i>third
selector</i> if further subdivision of groups is necessary; and finally it is
<i>a connector</i> when it is employed to pick out and connect with the
<i>particular line in the final group of one hundred lines</i> to which the
connection has been brought by the selectors. In a single office of
10,000-line capacity, therefore, we would have first and second selectors
and connectors, the first selectors picking out the thousands,
the second selectors the hundreds, and the connectors the individual
line. In a multi-office system we may have first, second, and third
selectors and connectors, the first selector picking out the office, the
second selector the thousands in that office, the third selector the
hundreds, and the connector the individual lines.</p>

<p><b>The Line Switch.</b> In addition to the selectors and connectors
there are line switches, which are comparatively simple, one individual
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Page 154]</a></span>to each line. Each of these has the function, purely automatic,
of always connecting a line, as soon as a call is originated on it, to
some one of a smaller group of first selectors available to that line.
This idea may be better grasped when it is understood that, in the
earlier systems of the Automatic Electric Company, there was a
first selector permanently associated with each line. By the addition
of the comparatively simple line switch, a saving of about ninety
per cent of the first selectors was effected, since the number of first
selectors was thereby reduced from a number equal to the number
of lines in a group to a number equal to the number of simultaneous
connections resulting from calls originating in that group. In other
words, by the line switch, the number of first selectors is determined
by the traffic rather than by the number of lines.</p>

<p><b>Scheme of Trunking.</b> With this understanding as to the names and
broader functions of the things involved, Fig. 381 may now be understood.
The line switch of the single line, as indicated here, has only
the power of selection among three trunks, but it is to be understood
that in actual practice, it would have access to a greater number,
usually ten. So, also, throughout this diagram we have shown the
apparatus and trunks arranged in groups of three instead of in groups
of ten, only the first three thousands groups being indicated and the
first three hundreds groups in each thousand. Again only three
levels instead of ten are indicated for each selecting switch, it being
understood that in the diagram the various levels are represented by
concentric arcs of circles, and the trunk contacts by dots on these
arcs.</p>

<p><i>Line-Switch Action.</i> When the subscriber, whose line is shown
at the bottom of the figure, begins to make a call, the line switch
acts to connect his line with one of the first selector trunks available
to it. This selection is entirely preliminary and, except to start
it, is in no way under the control of the calling subscriber. The
calling line now has under its control a first selector which, for
the time being, becomes individual to it. Let it be assumed that
the line switch found the first of the first selector trunks already appropriated
by some other switch, but that the second one of these
trunks was found idle. This trunk being appropriated by the line
switch places the center one of the first selectors shown under the
control of the subscriber's line. This first selector then acts in response
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Page 156]</a></span>to the first set of selective impulses sent out by his signal
transmitter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig381_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 381. Scheme of Trunking</b><br />
<a href="images/fig381.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>First Selector Action.</i> We will assume that the calling subscriber
desires to connect with No. 3213. The first movement of the subscriber's
signal transmitter will send, therefore, three impulses over
the line. These impulses will act on the vertical magnet of the first
selector switch to move it up three steps. On this "level" of the
contact bank of this switch all of the contacts will represent second
selector trunks leading to the <i>third</i> thousand group. The other
ends of these trunks will terminate in the wipers and also in the controlling
magnets of second selectors serving this thousand. This
function on the part of the first selector controlled by the act of the
subscriber will have thus selected a <i>group</i> of trunks leading to the
<i>third</i> thousand, but the subscriber has nothing to do with which one
of the trunks of this group will actually be used. Immediately
following the vertical movement of the first selector switch the rotary
movement of this switch will start and will continue until the wipers
of that switch have found contacts of an idle trunk leading to a second
selector. Assuming that the first trunk was the one found
idle, the first selector wipers would pause on the first pair of contacts
in the third level of its bank, and the trunk chosen may be seen leading
from that contact off to the group of second selectors belonging to
the third thousand. For clearness, the chosen trunks in this assumed
connection are shown heavier than the others.</p>

<p><i>Second Selector Action.</i> The next movement of the dial by the
subscriber in establishing his desired connection will send two impulses,
it being desired to choose the <i>second</i> hundred in the <i>third</i>
thousand. The first selector will have become inoperative before
this second series of impulses is sent and, therefore, only the second
selector will respond. Its vertical magnet acting under the influence
of these two impulses will step up its wiper contacts opposite the
second row of bank contacts, and the subscriber will thus have
chosen the <i>group</i> of trunks leading to the <i>second</i> hundred in the
<i>third</i> thousand. Here, again, the automatic operation of picking
out the first idle one of this chosen group of trunks will take place
without the volition of the subscriber, and it will be assumed that
the first two trunks on this level of the second selector were found
already engaged and that the third was therefore chosen. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Page 157]</a></span>connection continues, as indicated by heavy lines in Fig. 381, to the
third one of the connectors in the <i>second</i> hundred of the <i>third</i> thousand.
Any one of these connectors would have accomplished the
purpose but this is assumed to be the first one found idle by the
second selector.</p>

<p><i>Connector Action.</i> The third movement of the subscriber's dial
will send but one impulse, this corresponding to the <i>first</i> group of
ten in the <i>second</i> hundred in the <i>third</i> thousand. This impulse will
move the connector shaft up to the first level of bank contacts; and
from now on the action of the connector differs radically from that
of the selectors. The connector is not searching for an idle trunk in
the group but for a particular line and, therefore, having chosen the
group of ten lines in the desired hundred, the connector switch waits
for further guidance from the subscriber. This comes in the form
of the final set of impulses sent by the subscriber's signal transmitter
which, in this case, will be three in number, corresponding
to the final digit in the number of the called subscriber. This series
of impulses will control the rotary movement of the connector wipers
which will move along the first level and stop on the third one. The
process is seen to be one of successive selection, first of a large group,
then of a smaller, again of a smaller, and finally of an individual.</p>

<p>If the line is found not busy, the connection between the two
subscribers is complete and the called subscriber's bell will be rung.
If it is found busy, however, the connector will refuse to connect and
will drop back to its normal position, sending a busy signal back
to the calling subscriber. The details of ringing and the busy-back
operation may only be understood by a discussion of drawings, subsequently
to be referred to.</p>

<p><b>Two-Wire and Three-Wire Systems.</b> In most of the systems
of the Automatic Electric Company in use today the impulses by
which the subscriber controls the central-office apparatus flow over
one side of the line or the other and return by ground. The metallic
circuit is used for talking and for ringing the called subscriber's
bell, while ground return circuits, on one side of the line or the other,
are used for sending all the switch controlling impulses.</p>

<p>Recently this company has perfected a system wherein no
ground is required at the subscriber's station and no ground return
path is used for any purpose between the subscriber and the central
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Page 158]</a></span>office. This later system is known as the "two-wire" system, and in
contra-distinction to it, the earlier and most used system has been
referred to as the "three-wire." It is not meant by this that the line
circuits actually have three wires but that each line employs three
conductors, the two wires of the line and the earth. The three-wire
system will be referred to and described in detail, and from it
the principles of the two-wire system will be readily understood.</p>

<p><b>Subscriber's Station Apparatus.</b> The detailed operation of the
three-wire system may be best understood by considering the subscriber's
station apparatus first. The general appearance of the
wall set is shown in Fig. 382, and of the desk set in Fig. 383. These
instruments embody the usual talking and call-receiving apparatus
of a common-battery telephone and in addition to this, the signal
transmitter, which is the thing especially to be considered now. The
diagrammatic illustration of the signal transmitter and of the relation
that its parts bear to the other elements of the telephone set is shown
in Fig. 384. It has already been stated that the subscriber manipulates
the signal transmitter by rotating the dial on the face of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Page 159]</a></span>instrument. A clearer idea of this dial and of the finger stop for it
may be obtained from Figs. 382 and 383.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig384_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 384. Circuits of Telephone Set</b><br />
<a href="images/fig384.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>Operation.</i> To make a call for a given number the subscriber
removes his receiver from its hook, then places his forefinger in the
hole opposite the number corresponding to the first digit of the desired
number. By means of the grip thus secured, he rotates the
dial until its movement is stopped by the impact of the finger against
the stop. The dial is then released and in its return movement it
sends the number of impulses corresponding to the first digit in the
called number. A similar movement is made for each digit.</p>

<p>In Fig. 384 is given a phantom view of the dial, in order to show
more clearly the relation of the mechanical parts and contacts controlled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Page 160]</a></span>by it. For a correct idea of its mechanical action it must be
understood that the shaft <i>1</i>, the lever <i>2</i>, and the interrupter segment
<i>3</i> are all rigidly fastened to the dial and move with it. A coiled
spring always tends to move the dial and these associated parts
back to their normal positions when released by the subscriber, and
a centrifugal governor, not shown, limits the speed of the return movement.</p>

<p>The subscriber's hook switch is mechanically interlocked with
the dial so as to prevent the dial being moved from its normal position
until the hook is in its raised position. This interlocking function
involves also the pivoted dog <i>4</i>. Normally the lower end of this
dog lies in the path of the pin <i>5</i> carried on the lever <i>2</i>, and thus
the shaft, dial, and segment are prevented from any considerable movement
when the receiver is on the hook. However, when the receiver
is removed from its hook, the upwardly projecting arm from the
hook engages a projection on the dog <i>4</i> and moves the dog out of the
path of the pin <i>5</i>. Thus the dial is free to be rotated by the subscriber.
The pin <i>6</i> is mounted in a stationary position and serves
to limit the backward movement of the dial by the lever <i>2</i> striking
against it.</p>

<p>Ground Springs:&mdash;Five groups of contact springs must be
considered, some of which are controlled wholly by the position
of the switch hook, others jointly by the position of the switch hook
and the dial, others by the movement of the dial itself, and still others
by the pressure of the subscriber's finger on a button. The first of
these groups consists of the springs <i>7</i> and <i>8</i>, the function of which
is to control the continuity of the ground connection at the subscriber's
station. The arrangement of these two springs is such that the
ground connection will be broken until the subscriber's receiver is
removed from its hook. As soon as the receiver is raised, these
springs come together in an obvious manner, the dog <i>4</i> being lifted
out of the way by the action of the hook. The ledge on the lower
portion of the spring <i>7</i> serves as a rest for the insulated arm of the
dog <i>4</i> to prevent this dog, which is spring actuated, from returning
and locking the dial until after the receiver has been hung up.</p>

<p>Bell and Transmitter Springs:&mdash;The second group is that embracing
the springs <i>9</i>, <i>10</i>, <i>11</i>, and <i>12</i>. The springs <i>10</i> and <i>11</i>
are controlled by the lower projection from the switch hook, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Page 161]</a></span>spring <i>11</i> engaging the spring <i>12</i> only when the hook is down.
The spring <i>10</i> engages the spring <i>9</i> only when the hook lever
is up and not then unless the dial is in its normal position. While
the hook is raised, therefore, the springs <i>9</i> and <i>10</i> break contact
whenever the dial is moved and make contact again when it returns
to its normal position. The springs <i>11</i> and <i>12</i> control the circuit
through the subscriber's bell while the springs <i>9</i> and <i>10</i> control the
continuity of the circuit from one side of the line to the other so as
to isolate the limbs from each other while the signal transmitter
is sending its impulses to the central office.</p>

<p>Impulse Springs:&mdash;The third group embraces springs <i>13</i>, <i>14</i>,
and <i>15</i> and these are the ones by which the central-office switches
are controlled in building up a connection.</p>

<p>Something of the prevailing nomenclature which has grown
up about the automatic system may be introduced at this point.
The movements of the selecting switches at the central office are
referred to as <i>vertical</i> and <i>rotary</i> for obvious reasons. On account
of this the magnet which causes the vertical movement is referred to as
the <i>vertical magnet</i> and that which accomplishes the <i>rotary</i> movement
as the <i>rotary magnet</i>. It happens that in all cases the selecting
impulses sent by the subscriber's station, corresponding respectively
to the number of digits in the called subscriber's number, are sent
over one side of the line and in nearly all cases these selecting impulses
actuate the vertical movements of the selecting switches.
For this reason the particular limb of the line over which the selecting
impulses are sent is called the <i>vertical limb</i>. The other limb of the
line is the one over which the single impulse is sent after each group
of selecting impulses, and it is this impulse in every case which causes
the selector switch to start rotating in its hunt for an idle trunk.
This side of the line is, therefore, called <i>rotary</i>. For the same reasons
the impulses over the vertical side of the line are called <i>vertical
impulses</i> and those over the rotary side, <i>rotary impulses</i>. The naming
of the limbs of the line and of the current impulses <i>vertical</i> and
<i>rotary</i> may appear odd but it is, to say the least, convenient and expressive.</p>

<p>Coming back to the functions of the third group of springs,
<i>13</i>, <i>14</i>, and <i>15</i>, <i>15</i> may be called the <i>vertical spring</i> since it sends
vertical impulses; <i>13</i>, the <i>rotary spring</i> since it sends rotary impulses;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Page 162]</a></span>and <i>14</i>, the <i>ground spring</i> since, when the hook is up, it is connected
with the ground.</p>

<p>On the segment <i>3</i> there are ten projections or cams <i>16</i> which,
when the dial is moved, engage a projection of the spring <i>15</i>. When
the dial is being pulled by the subscriber's finger, these cams engage
the spring <i>15</i> in such a way as to move it away from the ground
spring and no electrical contact is made. On the return of the dial,
however, these cams engage the projection on the spring <i>15</i> in the
opposite way and the passing of each cam forces this vertical spring
into engagement with the ground spring. It will readily be seen,
therefore, by a consideration of the spacing of these cams on the
segment and the finger holes in the dial that the number of cams
which pass the vertical spring <i>15</i> will correspond to the number on
the hole used by the subscriber in moving the dial.</p>

<p>Near the upper right-hand corner of the segment <i>3</i>, as shown
in Fig. 384, there is another projection or cam <i>17</i>, the function of
which is to engage the rotary spring <i>13</i> and press it into contact with
the ground spring. Thus, the first thing that happens in the movement
of the dial is for the projection <i>17</i> to ride over the hump on the
rotary spring and press the contact once into engagement with the
ground spring; and likewise, the last thing that happens on the return
movement of the dial is for the rotary spring to be connected
once to the ground spring after the last vertical impulse has been
sent.</p>

<p>If both the rotary and vertical sides of the line are connected
with the live side of the central-office battery, it follows that every
contact between the vertical and the ground spring or between the
rotary and the ground spring will allow an impulse of current to flow
over the vertical or the rotary side of the line.</p>

<p>We may summarize the action of these impulse springs by
saying that whenever the dial is moved from its normal position,
there is, at the beginning of this movement, a single rotary impulse
over the rotary side of the line; and that while the dial returns,
there is a series of vertical impulses over the vertical side of the line;
and just before the dial reaches its normal position, after the sending
of the last vertical impulse, there is another impulse over the rotary
side of the line.</p>

<p>The mechanical arrangements of the interrupter segment <i>3</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Page 163]</a></span>its associated parts have been greatly distorted in Fig. 384 in order
to make clear their mode of operation. This drawing has been
worked out with great care, with this in mind, at a sacrifice of accuracy
in regard to the actual structural details.</p>

<p>Ringing Springs:&mdash;The fourth group of springs in the subscriber's
telephone is the ringing group and embraces the springs
<i>18</i>, <i>19</i>, and <i>20</i>. The springs <i>19</i> and <i>20</i> are normally closed and
maintain the continuity of the talking circuit. When, however,
the button attached to the spring <i>19</i>&mdash;which button may be seen
projecting from the instrument shown in Fig. 382, and from the base
of the one shown in Fig. 383&mdash;is pressed, the continuity of the talking
circuit is interrupted and the vertical side of the line is connected
with the ground. It is by this operation, after the connection has
been made with the desired subscriber's line, that the central-office
apparatus acts to send ringing current out on that line.</p>

<p>Release Springs:&mdash;The fifth set of springs is the one shown at
the left-hand side of Fig. 384, embracing springs <i>21</i>, <i>22</i>, and <i>23</i>. The
long curved spring <i>21</i> is engaged by the projecting lug on the switch
hook when it rises so as to press this spring away from the other
two. On the return movement of the hook, however, this spring
is pressed to the left so as to bring all three of them into contact,
and this, it will be seen, grounds both limbs of the line at the subscriber's
station. This combination cannot be effected by any of
the other springs at any stage of their operation, and it is the one
which results in the energization of such a combination of relays
and magnets at the central office as will release all parts involved in
the connection and allow them to return to their normal positions
ready for another call.</p>

<p><i>Salient Points.</i> If the following things are borne in mind about
the operation of the subscriber's station apparatus, an understanding
of the central-office operations will be facilitated. First, the selective
impulses always flow over the vertical side of the line; they are
always preceded and always followed by a single impulse over the
rotary side of the line. The ringing button grounds the vertical side
of the line and the release springs ground both sides of the line
simultaneously.</p>

<p><b>The Line Switch.</b> The first thing to be considered in connection
with the central-office apparatus is the line switch. This, it will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Page 164]</a></span>be remembered, is the device introduced into each subscriber's line
at the central office for the purpose of effecting a reduction of the
number of first selectors required at the central office, and also for
bringing about certain important functional results in connection
with trunking between central and sub-offices. The function of the
line switch in connection with the subscriber's line, however, is
purely that of reducing the number of first selectors.</p>

<p>The line switches of one hundred lines are all associated to
form a single unit of apparatus, which, besides the individual line
switches, includes certain other apparatus common to those lines.
Such a group of one hundred line switches and associated common
apparatus is called a <i>line-switch unit</i>, or frequently, a <i>Keith unit</i>.
Confusion is likely to arise in the mind of the reader between the
individual line switch and the line-switch unit, and to avoid this we
will refer to the piece of apparatus individual to the line as the line
switch, and to the complete unit formed of one hundred of these devices
as a line-switch unit.</p>

<p><i>Line and Trunk Contacts.</i> Each line switch has its own bank
of contacts arranged in the arc of a circle, and in this same arc are
also placed the contacts of each of the ten individual trunks which
it is possible for that line to appropriate. The contacts individual to
the subscriber's line in the line switch are all multipled together,
the arrangement being such that if a wedge or plunger is inserted at
any point, the line contacts will be squeezed out of their normal position
so as to engage the contacts of the trunk corresponding to the
particular position in the arc at which the wedge or plunger is inserted.
A small plunger individual to each line is so arranged that
it may be thrust in between the contact springs in the line-switch
bank in such manner as to connect any one of the trunks with the
line terminals represented in that row, the particular trunk so connected
depending on the portion of the arc toward which the
plunger is pointed at the time it is thrust in the contacts.</p>

<p>These banks of lines and trunk contacts are horizontally arranged,
and piled in vertical columns of twenty-five line switches each. The
ten trunk contacts are multipled vertically through the line-switch
banks, so that the same ten trunks are available to each of the
twenty-five lines. We thus have, in effect, an old style, Western
Union, cross-bar switchboard, the line contacts being represented
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Page 165]</a></span>in horizontal rows and the trunk contacts in vertical rows, the connection
between any line and any trunk being completed by inserting
a plunger at the point of intersection of the horizontal and the vertical
rows corresponding to that line and trunk.</p>

<p><i>Trunk Selection.</i> The plungers by which the lines and trunks
are connected are, as has been said, individual to the line, and all
of the twenty-five plungers in a vertical row are mounted in such
manner as to be normally held in the same vertical plane, and this
vertical plane is made to oscillate back and forth by an oscillating
shaft so as always <i>to point the plungers toward a vertical row of
trunk contacts that represent a trunk that is not in use at the time</i>.
The to-and-fro movement of this oscillating shaft, called the <i>master
bar</i>, is controlled by a master switch and the function of this master
switch is always to keep the plungers pointed toward the row of
contacts of an idle trunk. The thrusting movement of the individual
plungers into the contact bank is controlled by magnets
individual to the line and under control of the subscriber in
initiating a call. As soon as the plunger of a line has been thus
thrust into the contact bank so as to connect the terminals of that
line with a given trunk, the plunger is no longer controlled by the
master bar and remains stationary. The master bar then at once
moves all of the other plungers that are not in use so that they will
point to the terminals of another trunk that is not in use. The
plungers of all the line switches in a group of twenty-five are, therefore,
subject to the oscillating movements of the master bar when
the line is not connected to a first selector trunk. As soon as a call
is originated on a line, the corresponding plunger is forced into the
bank and is held stationary in maintaining the connection to a first
selector trunk, and all of the other plungers not so engaged, move on
so as to be ready to engage another idle trunk.</p>

<p><i>Trunk Ratio.</i> The assignment of ten trunks to twenty-five
lines would be a greater ratio of trunks than ordinary traffic conditions
require. This ratio of trunks to lines is, however, readily
varied by multipling the trunk contacts of several twenty-five line
groups together. Thus, ten trunks may be made available to one
hundred subscribers' lines by multipling the trunks of four twenty-five
line switch groups together. In this case the four master bars
corresponding to the four groups of twenty-five line switches are all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Page 166]</a></span>mechanically connected together so as to move in unison under the
control of a single master switch. If more than ten and less than
twenty-one trunks are assigned to one hundred lines, then each set
of ten trunks is multipled to the trunk contacts of fifty line switches,
the two master bars of these switches being connected together and
controlled by a common master switch.</p>

<p><i>Structure of Line Switch.</i> The details of the parts of a line
switch that are individual to the line are shown in Fig. 385, the line
and trunk contact bank being shown in the lower portion of this
figure and also in a separate view in the detached figure at the right.
A detailed group of several such line switches with the oscillating
master bar is shown in Fig. 386. This figure shows quite clearly
the relative arrangement of the line and trunk contact banks, the
plungers for each bank, and the master bar.</p>

<p>In practice, four groups of twenty-five line switches each are
mounted on a single framework and the group of one hundred line
switches, together with certain other portions of the apparatus that
will be referred to later, form a line-switch unit. A front view of
such a unit is shown in Fig. 387. In order to give access to all portions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Page 167]</a></span>of the wiring and apparatus, the framework supporting each
column of fifty line switches is hinged so as to open up the interior
of the device as a whole. A line-switch unit thus opened out is shown
in Fig. 388.</p>

<p><i>Circuit Operation.</i> The mode of operation of the line switch
may be best understood in connection with Fig. 389, which shows
in a schematic way the parts of a line switch that are individual to a
subscriber's line, and also those that are common to a group of fifty
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Page 170]</a></span>or one hundred lines. Those portions of Fig. 389 which are individual
to the line are shown below the dotted line extending across
the page. The task of understanding the line switch will be made
somewhat easier if Figs. 385 and 389 are considered together. The
individual parts of the line switch are shown in the same relation to
each other in these two figures with the exception that the bank of
line and trunk springs in the lower right-hand corner of Fig. 389
have been turned around edgewise so as to make an understanding
of their circuit connections possible.</p>

<p>The vertical and rotary sides of the subscriber's line are shown
entering at the lower left-hand corner of this figure, and they pass
to the springs of the contact bank. Immediately adjacent to these
springs are the trunk contacts from which the vertical and the rotary
limbs of the first selector trunk proceed. The plunger is indicated
at <i>1</i>, it being in the form of a wheel of insulating material.
It is carried on the rod <i>2</i> pivoted on a lever <i>3</i>, which, in turn, is pivoted
at <i>4</i> in a stationary portion of the framework. A spring <i>5</i>, secured
to the underside of the lever <i>3</i> and projecting to the left beyond the
pivot <i>4</i> of this lever, serves always to press the right-hand portion of
the lever <i>3</i> forward in such direction as to tend to thrust it into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Page 171]</a></span>contact bank. The plunger is normally held out of the contact
bank by means of the latch <i>6</i> carried on the armature <i>7</i> of the trip
magnet. When the trip magnet is energized it pulls the armature
<i>7</i> to the left and thus releases the plunger and allows it to enter the
contact bank.</p>

<p>The master bar is shown at <i>8</i>, and a feather on this bar engages
a notch in the segment attached to the rear end of the plunger rod <i>2</i>.
This master bar is common to all of the plunger rods and by its oscillatory
movement, under the influence of the master switch, it always
keeps all of the idle plunger bars pointed toward the contacts
of an idle trunk. As soon, however, as the trip magnet is operated
to cause the insertion of a plunger into the contact bank, the feather
on the master bar is disengaged by the notch in the segment of the
plunger rod, and the plunger rod is, therefore, no longer subject to
the oscillating movement of the master bar.</p>

<p>When the release magnet is energized, it attracts its armature
<i>9</i> and this lifts the armature <i>7</i> of the trip magnet so that the latch <i>6</i>
rides on top of the left-hand end of the lever <i>3</i>. Then, when the release
magnet is de-energized, the spring <i>5</i>, which was put under
tension by the latch, moves the entire structure of levers back
to its normal position, withdrawing the plunger from the bank of
contacts. The notch on the edge of the segment of the plunger
rod, when thus released, will probably not strike the feather on the
master bar, and the plunger rod will thus not come under the control
of the master bar until the master bar has moved, in its oscillation,
so that the feather registers with the notch, after which this bar
will move with all the others.</p>

<p>If, while the plunger is waiting to be picked up by the master
bar, the same subscriber should call again, his line will be connected
with the same trunk as before. There is no danger in this, however,
that the trunk will be found busy, because the master bar will not
have occupied a position which would make it possible for any of
the lines to appropriate this trunk during the intervening time.</p>

<p><i>Master Switch.</i> Associated with each master bar there is a
master switch which determines the position in which the master
bar shall stop in order that the idle plungers may be pointed
always to the contacts of an idle trunk. The arm <i>10</i> of this
switch is attached to the master bar and oscillates with it and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Page 172]</a></span>serves to connect the segment <i>11</i> successively with the contacts <i>12</i>,
which are connected respectively to the third, or release wire of
each first selector trunk. In the figure the arm <i>10</i> is shown resting
on the sixth contact of the switch and this sixth contact is connected
to a spring <i>13</i> in the line-switch contact bank that has not yet been
referred to. As soon as the plunger is inserted into the contact
bank, the spring <i>14</i> will be pressed into engagement with the spring
<i>13</i>, and this spring <i>14</i> is connected with the live side of the battery
through the release magnet winding.</p>

<p>The contact strip <i>11</i> on the master switch is thus connected
through the release magnet to the battery and from this current
flows through the left-hand winding of the master-switch relay.
This energizes this relay and causes the closure of the circuit of
the locking magnet which magnet unlocks the master bar to permit
its further rotation. The unlocking of the master bar brings the
spring <i>15</i> into engagement with <i>16</i> and thus energizes the master
magnet, the armature of which vibrates back and forth after the
manner of an electric-bell armature, and steps the wheel <i>17</i> around.
The wheel <i>17</i> is mechanically connected to the master bar so that
each complete revolution of the wheel will cause one complete oscillation
of the master bar. The master bar will thus be moved so as to
cause all the idle plungers to sweep through an arc and this movement
will stop as soon as the master-switch arm <i>10</i> connects the
arc <i>11</i> with one of the contacts <i>12</i> that is not connected to the live
side of the battery through the springs <i>13</i> and <i>14</i> of some other line
switch. It is by this means that the plungers of the line switches
are always kept pointing at the contacts of an idle trunk. The way
in which this feature has been worked out must demand admiration
and accounts for the marvelous quickness of this line switch. The
fact that the plungers are pointed in the right direction before the
time comes for their use, leaves only the simple thrusting motion of
the plunger to accomplish the desired connection immediately upon
the initiation of a call by the subscriber.</p>

<p><i>Locking Segment.</i> It will be understood that the locking segment
<i>18</i> and the master-switch contact finger <i>10</i> are both rigidly connected
with the master bar <i>8</i> and move with it, the locking segment
<i>18</i> serving always to determine accurately the angular position at
which the master bar and the master-switch arm are brought to rest.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Page 173]</a></span></p><p><i>Bridge Cut-Off.</i> One important feature of automatic switching,
particularly as exemplified in the system of the Automatic Electric
Company, is the disconnection, after its use, of each operating
magnet of each piece of apparatus involved in making a connection.
Since these operating magnets are always bridged across the line at
the time of their operation and then cut off after they have performed
their function, this feature may be referred to as the <i>bridge cut-off</i>.</p>

<p><i>Guarding Functions.</i> Still another feature of importance is
the means for guarding a line or a piece of apparatus that has already
been appropriated or made busy, so that it will not be appropriated
or connected with for use in some other connection. For this latter
purpose contacts and wires are associated with each piece of apparatus,
which are multipled to similar contacts on other pieces of apparatus
in much the same way and for a similar purpose that the
test thimbles in a multiple switchboard are multipled together.
Such wires and contacts in the Automatic Electric Company's apparatus
are called <i>private wires</i> and <i>contacts</i>.</p>

<p>The bridge cut-off and guarding functions are provided for in
the line switch by a bridge cut-off relay shown in Fig. 389 and also
in Fig. 385, it being the upper one of the individual line relays in
each of those figures. This bridge cut-off relay is operated as soon
as the plunger of the line is thrust into the bank; the contacts <i>19</i> and
<i>20</i>, closed by the plunger, serving to complete the circuit of this relay.
To make clear the bridge cut-off feature it will be noted that the trip
magnet of a line switch is connected in a circuit traced from the
rotary side of the line through the contacts <i>21</i> and <i>22</i> of the bridge
cut-off relay, thence through the coil of the trip magnet to the common
wire leading to the spring <i>23</i> of the master-bar locking device
and thence to the live side of the battery. Obviously, therefore, as
soon as the bridge cut-off relay operates, the trip magnet becomes
inoperative and can cause no further action of the line switch because
its circuit is broken between the springs <i>21</i> and <i>22</i>.</p>

<p>The private or guarding feature is taken care of by the action
of the plunger in closing contacts <i>19</i> and <i>20</i>, since the private wire
leading to the bridge cut-off relay is, as has already been stated, connected
to ground when these contacts are closed. This private wire
leads off and is multipled to the private contacts on all the connectors
that have the ability to reach this line, and the fact that this wire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Page 174]</a></span>is grounded by the line switch as soon as it becomes busy, establishes
such conditions at all of the connectors that they will refuse
to connect with this line as long as it is busy, in a way that will be
pointed out later on.</p>

<p><i>Relation of Line Switch and Connectors.</i> The vertical and
rotary wires of the subscriber's line are shown leading off to the
connector banks at the left-hand side of Fig. 389, and one side of this
connection passes through the contacts <i>24</i> and <i>25</i> of the bridge cut-off
relay on the line switch. It is through this path that a connection
from some other line through a connector to this line is established
and it is seen that this path is held open until the bridge cut-off relay
of the line switch is operated. For such a connection to this line the
bridge cut-off relay of the line switch is operated over the private
wire leading from the connector, and the operation of the bridge cut-off
relay at this time serves to render inoperative the line switch, so
that it will not perform its usual functions should the called subscriber
start to make a call after his line had been seized.</p>

<p><i>Summary of Line-Switch Operation.</i> To summarize the operation
of a line switch when a call is originated on its line, the
first movement of the calling subscriber's dial will ground the rotary
side of the line and operate the trip magnet. This will cause
the plunger to be inserted into the bank, and thus extend the line to
the first selector trunk through the closing of the right-hand set of
springs shown in the lower right-hand corner of Fig. 389. The
insertion of the plunger will also connect the battery through the
left-hand winding of the master-switch relay and, by the sequence of
operations which follows, cause the master bar to move all of the idle
plungers so as to again point them to an idle trunk. The closure of
contacts <i>19</i> and <i>20</i> by the plunger causes the operation of the bridge
cut-off relay which opens the circuit of the trip magnet, rendering it
inoperative; and also establishes ground potential on all the private
wire contacts of that line in the banks of the connectors, so as
to guard the line and its associated apparatus against intrusion by
others. The line is cut through, therefore, to a first selector and all
of the line-switch apparatus is completely cut off from the talking
circuit.</p>

<p>It must be remembered that all of the actions of the line switch,
which it has taken so long to describe, occur practically instantaneously
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Page 175]</a></span>and as a result of the first part of the first movement of the subscriber's
dial. The line switch has done its work and "gone out of
business" before the selective impulses of the first digit begin to
take place.</p>

<p><b>Selecting Switches.</b> The first selector is now in control of the
calling subscriber. The circuits and elements of the first selector
switch are shown in Fig. 390. The general mechanical structure
of the first selectors, second selectors, and connectors, is the same
and may be referred to briefly here. Fig. 391 shows a rear view of a
first selector; Fig. 392, a side view of a second selector; and Fig.
393, a front view of a connector. The arrangement of the vertical
and rotary magnets, of the selector shafts, and of the contact banks
are identical in all three of these pieces of apparatus and all these
switches work on the "up-and-around principle" referred to in connection
with Fig. 380. It is thought that with the general structure
shown in Figs. 391, 392, and 393 in mind, the actual operation may
be understood much more readily from Fig. 390.</p>

<p>Four magnets&mdash;the vertical, the rotary, the private, and the release&mdash;produce
the switching movements of the machine. These
magnets are controlled by various combinations brought upon the
circuits by three relays&mdash;the vertical, the rotary, and the back release.
The fourth relay shown, called the <i>off-normal</i>, is purely for
signaling purposes, as will be described.</p>

<p><i>Side Switch.</i> Another important element of the selecting
switches is the so-called side switch which might better be called a
pilot switch&mdash;but we are not responsible for its name. This side
switch has for its function the changing of the control of the subscriber's
line to successive portions of the selector mechanism, rendering
inoperative those portions that have already performed their
functions and that, therefore, are no longer needed. This switch
may be seen best in Fig. 392 just above the upper bank of contacts.
It is shown in Fig. 390 greatly distorted mechanically so as to better
illustrate its electrical functions.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig390_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 390. Circuits of First Selector</b><br />
<a href="images/fig390.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The contact levers <i>1</i>, <i>2</i>, <i>3</i>, and <i>4</i> of the side switch are carried
upon the arm <i>5</i> which is pivoted at <i>6</i>. All of these contact levers,
therefore, move about <i>6</i> as an axis. The side switch has three positions
and it is shown, in Fig. 390, in the first one of these. When
the private magnet armature is attracted and released once, the escapement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Page 177]</a></span>carried by it permits the spring <i>7</i> to move the arm <i>5</i> so as
to bring the wipers of the side switch into its second position; the
second pulling up and release of the private magnet armature will
cause the movement of the side switch wipers into the third position.
It is to be noted that the escapement
which releases the side
switch arm may be moved either
by the private or by the rotary
magnet, since the armature of the
latter has a finger which engages
the private magnet armature.</p>

<p><i>Functions of Side Switch.</i>
The functions of the side switch
may be briefly outlined in connection
with the first selector, as
an example. In the first position
it extends the control of the subscriber's
signal transmitter through
the first selector trunk and line
relays to the vertical and private
magnets so that these magnets
will be responsive to the selecting
impulses corresponding to the first
digit. In its second position it
brings about such a condition of
affairs that the rotary magnet will
be brought into play and automatically
move the wipers over
the bank contacts in search of an
idle trunk. In its third position,
both the vertical and rotary relays
are cut off and the line is cut
straight through to the second selector
trunk, and only those parts
of the first selector apparatus are left in an operative state which
have to do with the private or guarding circuits and with the release.
Similar functions are performed by the side switch in connection
with the other selecting switches.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Page 178]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 392. Side View of Second Selector</b><br />
<a href="images/fig392.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>Release Mechanism.</i> Another one of the features of the switch
that needs to be considered before a detailed understanding of its
operation may be had, is the mechanical relation of the holding and
the release dog. This dog is shown at <i>8</i> and, in the language of
the art, is called the <i>double dog</i>.
As will be seen, it has two retaining
fingers, one adapted to engage
the vertical ratchet and the
other, the rotary ratchet on the
selector shaft. This double dog
is pivoted at <i>9</i> and is interlinked
in a peculiar way with the armature
of the vertical magnet, the
armature of the release magnet,
and the arm of the side switch.
The function of this double dog
is to hold the shaft in whatever
vertical position it is moved by
the vertical magnet and then,
when the rotary magnet begins
to operate, to hold the shaft in
its proper angular position. It
will be noted that the fixed dog
<i>10</i> is ineffective when the shaft
is in its normal angular position.
But as soon as the shaft is rotated,
this fixed dog <i>10</i> becomes the
real holding pawl so far as the
vertical movement is concerned.
The double dog <i>8</i> is normally
held out of engagement with the
vertical and the rotary ratchets
by virtue of the link connection,
shown at <i>11</i>, between the release
magnet armature and the rear
end of the double dog. On the previous release of the switch the
attraction of the release magnet armature permitted the link <i>11</i> to
hook over the end of the dog <i>8</i> and thus, on its return movement,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Page 179]</a></span>to pull this dog out of engagement with its ratchets. This movement
also resulted in pushing on the link <i>12</i> which is pivoted to the
side switch arm <i>5</i>, and thus the return movement of the release
magnet is made to restore the side switch to its normal position.
In order that the double dog may
be made effective when it is required,
and in order that the side
switch may be free to move under
the influence of the private magnet,
the double dog is released
from its connection with the release
magnet armature by the first
movement of the vertical magnet
in a manner which is clear from
the drawing.</p>

<p><b>First Selector Operation.</b> In
discussing the details of operation
of the various selectors it will be
found convenient to divide the
discussion according to the position
of the side switch. This will
bring about a logical arrangement
because it is really the side switch
which determines by its position
the sequence of operation.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig393_t.jpg" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 393. Front View of Connector</b><br />
<a href="images/fig393.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>First Position of Side Switch.</i>
This is the position shown in Fig.
390, and is the normal position.
The vertical and the rotary lines
extending from the calling subscriber
are continued by the levers
<i>1</i> and <i>2</i> of the side switch through
the vertical and the rotary relay
coils, respectively, to the live side
of battery. The lever <i>4</i> of the
side switch in this position connects to ground the circuit leading
from the line switch through the release trunk, and the winding
of the off-normal relay. This winding is thus put in series
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Page 180]</a></span>with the release magnet of the line switch, but on account of high
resistance of the off-normal relay no operation of the release magnet
is caused. This will, however, permit such current to flow through
the release circuit as will energize the sensitive off-normal relay
and cause it to attract its armature and light the off-normal lamp.
If this lamp remains lighted more than a brief period of time, it
will attract notice and will indicate that the corresponding selector
has been appropriated by a line switch and that for some reason the
selector has gone no further. This lamp, therefore, is an aid in
preventing the continuance of this abnormal condition.</p>

<p>The first thing that happens after the line switch has connected
the calling subscriber with the first selector is a succession of impulses
over the vertical side of the line, this being the set of impulses
corresponding in number to the thousands digit or to the office, if
there is more than one. It will be understood that here we are considering
a single office of ten-thousand-line capacity or thereabouts,
and that, therefore, this first set of impulses corresponds to the
thousands digit in the called subscriber's line. Each one of these impulses
will flow from the battery through the vertical relay and each
movement of this relay armature will close the circuit of the vertical
magnet and cause the shaft of the selector to be stepped up to the
proper level. Immediately following the first series of selecting
impulses from the subscriber's station, a single impulse follows
over the rotary side of the line. This gives the rotary relay armature
one impulse and this in turn closes the circuit of the private
magnet once. The single movement of the private magnet armature
allows the escapement finger on the arm <i>5</i> to move one step and
this brings the side switch contacts into the second position.</p>

<p><i>Second Position of Side Switch.</i> In this position lever <i>4</i> of the
side switch places a ground on the wire leading through the rotary
magnet to a source of interrupted battery current. The impulses
which thus flow through the rotary magnet occur at a frequency
dependent upon the battery interrupter and this is at a rate of approximately
fifteen impulses per second. The rotary magnet will
step the selector shaft rapidly around until something occurs to stop
these impulses. This something is the finding by the private wiper
of an ungrounded private contact in the bank, since all of the contacts
corresponding to busy trunks are grounded, as will be explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Page 181]</a></span></p><p>The action of the private magnet enters into this operation in
the following way: A circuit may be traced from the battery through
the private magnet to the third side switch wiper when in its second
position, thence through the back release relay to the private
wiper. If the wiper is at the time on the private bank contact of a
busy trunk, it will find that contact grounded and the private magnet
will be energized. The energizing of this magnet will not, however,
cause the release of the side switch. It must be energized and
de-energized. The private magnet armature will, therefore, be operated
by the finger of the rotary magnet armature on the first rotary
step. The private magnet will be energized and hold its armature
operated if the private wiper finds a ground on the first bank contact
and will stay energized as long as the private wiper is passing
over private contacts of busy trunks. Its armature will not be
allowed to fall back during the passage of the wiper from one trunk
to another, because during that interval the finger of the rotary
magnet will hold it operated. As soon, however, as the private
wiper reaches the private bank contact of an idle trunk, no ground
will be found and the circuit of the private magnet will be left open.
When the impulse through the rotary magnet ceases, the private
magnet armature will fall back and the side switch will be released to
its third position.</p>

<p><i>Third Position of Side Switch.</i> The first thing to be noted in this
position is that the calling line is cut straight through to the second
selector trunk, the connection being clean with no magnets bridged
across or tapped off. The third wiper of the side switch, when in its
third position, is grounded and this connects the release wire of the
second selector trunk, on which the switch wipers rest, through the
private wiper, the winding of the back release magnet, and the third
wiper of the side switch to ground. This establishes a path for the
subsequent release current through the back release magnet; and, of
equal importance, it places a ground on the private bank contact of
that trunk so that the private wiper of any other switch will be prevented
from stopping on the contacts of this trunk in the same manner
that the wiper of this switch was prevented from stopping on other
trunks that were already in use.</p>

<p>The fourth lever on the side switch, when in its third position,
serves merely to close the circuit of the rotary off-normal lamp. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Page 182]</a></span>lamp is for the purpose of calling attention to any first selector switch
that has been brought into connection with some second selector
trunk and which, for some reason, has failed in its release. These
off-normal lamps are so arranged that they may be switched off
manually to avoid burning them during the hours of heaviest
traffic. At night they afford a ready means of testing for switches
that have been left off-normal, since the manual switches controlling
these lamps may then be closed, and any lamps which burn will show
that the switches corresponding to them are off-normal. Simple
tests then suffice to show whether they are properly or improperly
in their off-normal position.</p>

<p><i>Release of the First Selector.</i> As will be shown later, the normal
way of releasing the switches is from the connector back over the release
wire. It is sufficient to say at this point that when the proper
time for release comes, an impulse of current will come back over
the second selector trunk release wire through the private wiper,
to the back release relay magnet, and thence to ground through the
third wiper of the side switch which is in its third position. It may
be asked why the back release magnet was not energized during the
previous operations described, when current passed through it.
The reason for this is that in those previous operations the private
magnet was always included in series in the circuit and on account of
the high resistance of the private magnet, sufficient current did not
pass through the back release magnet to energize it.</p>

<p>When the back release relay is energized, it closes the circuit
of the release magnet and thus, through the link <i>11</i>, draws the double
dog away from its engagement with the shaft ratchets and at the same
time, through the link <i>12</i>, restores the side switch to its normal position.
Whenever the release magnet is operated it acts as a relay to close a
pair of contacts associated with it and thus to momentarily ground
the release wire of the first selector trunk extending back to the line
switch. Referring to Fig. 389, it will be seen that this path leads
through the contacts <i>13</i> and <i>14</i> and the release magnet to the battery.
It is by this means that the line switch is released, the release
impulse being relayed back from the first selector.</p>

<p><b>Second Selector Operation.</b> For the purpose of considering the
action of the second selector, we will go back to the point where the
first selector had connected with a second selector trunk and where
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Page 183]</a></span>its side switch had moved into its third position. In this condition,
it will be remembered, the trunk line was cut through to a second
selector trunk and all first selector apparatus cleared from the
talking circuit.</p>

<p>The second selector chosen is one corresponding to the thousands
group as determined by the first digit of the called subscriber's
number. The circuits of a second selector are shown in Fig. 394
and it must be borne in mind that the mechanical arrangements for
producing the vertical and the rotary movement of the shaft and
for operating the side switch are practically the same as those of the
first selector. As in the first selector, the sequence of operation
is controlled by the successive positions of the side switch, the
first position permitting the selection of the hundreds corresponding
to the vertical impulses, the second position allowing the selector
to search for an idle trunk in that hundred, and the third position
cutting the trunk through and clearing the circuit of obstructing
apparatus.</p>

<p><i>First Position of Side Switch.</i> The first thing that happens
when the subscriber begins to move his dial in the transmission of
the second series of selecting impulses is the sending of a preliminary
impulse over the rotary side of the line. This, in the case of the
second selector, energizes the rotary relay which, in turn, energizes
the private magnet; but the private magnet in the case of the second
selector can do nothing toward the release of the side switch because
the projection <i>5'</i>, on the side switch arm <i>5</i>, meets a projection on the
rear of the selector shaft which thus prevents the movement of the
side switch arm <i>5</i> until the selector shaft has been moved out of
its normal position.</p>

<p>Immediately after the establishment of the connection to the
selector, the second set of selecting impulses comes in over the vertical
wire from the subscriber's station. These impulses, corresponding
in number to the hundreds digit, will energize the vertical
relay and cause it, in turn, to energize the vertical magnet, stepping
up the selector shaft to the level corresponding to the hundred sought.
The single rotary impulse, which follows just before the subscriber's
dial reaches its normal position, will energize the rotary relay of the
second selector. This, in turn, energizes the private magnet which
makes a single movement of its armature and allows the escapement
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Page 185]</a></span>finger on the side switch arm to move one step and bring the side
switch contacts into the second position.</p>

<p><i>Second Position of Side Switch.</i> No detailed discussion of this is
necessary, since, with the side switch in its second position, the actions
which occur in causing the wipers of the second selector to seek and connect
with an idle trunk line, are exactly the same as in the case of the
first selector. When the second selector wipers finally reach a resting
place on the bank contacts, the private magnet armature, operated
during the hunting process, is released and the side switch is thus
shifted into the third position.</p>

<p><i>Third Position of Side Switch.</i> The moving of the side switch
into its final position brings about the same state of affairs with respect
to the second selector that already exists with respect to the
first selector. The trunk line is cut straight through and all bridge
circuits or by-paths from it are cut off. The same guarding conditions
are established to prevent other lines or other pieces of apparatus
from making connections that will interfere with the one being established,
and the same provisions are made for working the back
release when the proper impulse comes from the connector, and for
passing this back release impulse on to the first selector in the same
way that the first selector passes it on to the line switch. The line
of the calling subscriber has now been extended to a connector, and
that connector is one of a group&mdash;usually ten&mdash;which alone has the
ability to reach the particular hundred lines containing the line of
the desired subscriber. The selection has, therefore, been narrowed
down from one in ten thousand to one in one hundred.</p>

<p><b>The Connector</b>&mdash;<i>Its Functions.</i> It has already been stated
that the connector is of the same general type of apparatus as the
first and the second selectors. Unlike the first and the second
selectors, however, the connector is required to make a double selection
under the guidance of the subscriber. The first selector makes
a single selection of a group under the guidance of the subscriber
and then an automatic selection in that group not controlled by the
subscriber. So it is with the second selector. The connector, however,
makes a selection of a group of ten under the guidance of the
subscriber and then, again under the guidance of the subscriber,
it picks out a particular one of that group.</p>

<p>The connector also has other functions in relation to the ringing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Page 186]</a></span>of the called subscriber and the giving of a busy signal to the calling
subscriber in case the line wanted is found busy. It has still other
functions in that the talking current, which is finally supplied to
connected subscribers, is supplied through paths furnished by it.</p>

<p><i>Location of the Connectors.</i> Connectors are the only ones of
the selecting switches that are in any sense individual to the subscribers'
lines. None of them is individual to a subscriber's line, but it
may be said that a group of ten connectors is individual to a group of
one hundred subscribers' lines. Since each group of one hundred
lines has a group of connectors of its own and since each one hundred
lines also has a line-switch unit of its own, and since the lines of
this group must be multipled through the bank contacts of the
connectors of this individual group and through the bank contacts
of the line switches of this particular unit, it follows that on account
of the wiring problems involved there is good reason for mounting
the connectors in close proximity to the line switches representing
the same group of lines. Some help in the grasping of this thought
may result if it be remembered that the line switch is, so to speak,
the point of entry of a call and that the connector is the point of exit,
and, in order to reduce the amount of wiring and to economize space,
the point of exit and the point of entry are made as close together
as possible.</p>

<p>The relative locations and grouping of the line switches and
connectors are clearly shown in Fig. 395, which is a rear view of the
same line-switch unit that was illustrated in Figs. 387 and 388.</p>

<p><b>Operation of the Connector.</b> The circuits of the connector
are shown in Fig. 396. In addition to the features that have been
pointed out in the first and the second selectors, all of which are
to be found, with some modifications, perhaps, in the connector,
there must be considered the features in the connector of busy-signal
operation, of ringing the called subscriber, of battery supply to
both subscribers, and of the trunk release operation. These may
be best understood by tracing through the operations of the connector
from the time it is picked up by a second selector until the connection
is finally completed, or until the busy signal has been given in case
completion was found impossible. As in the first and the second
selectors, the sequence of operations is determined by the position
of the side switch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Page 189]</a></span></p><p><i>First Position of Side Switch.</i> The connector in a ten-thousand-line
system is the recipient of the impulses resulting from the third
and fourth movements of the subscriber's dial. Considering the
third movement of the subscriber's dial, the first impulse resulting
from it comes over the rotary side of the line and results in the rotary
relay attracting its armature once. This results in a single impulse
through the private magnet which, however, does nothing because the
projection <i>5'</i> strikes against a projection on the selector shaft. These
two projections interfere only when the selector shaft is in its normal
position. Then follows the series of impulses from the subscriber's
station corresponding to the tens digit in the called subscriber's
number. These pass over the vertical side of the line and through
the vertical relay, energizing that relay a corresponding number
of times.</p>

<p>The vertical magnet, as in the case of the first and the second
selectors, is included in the circuit controlled by the vertical relay
and this results in the connector shaft being stepped up to the level
corresponding to the particular tens group containing the called subscriber's
number. It will be noted that the impulses from the vertical
side of the line, which cause this selection, pass through one winding
<i>13</i> of the calling battery supply relay. This relay is operated by
these vertical selecting impulses, but in this position of the side switch
the closure of its local circuits accomplishes nothing.</p>

<p>Immediately after the tens group of selecting impulses over the
vertical side of the line, there follows a single rotary impulse from the
subscriber's station which, as in the case of the first and the second
selectors, energizes the rotary relay and causes it to give one impulse
to the private magnet. This impulse is now able, since the shaft
has moved from its normal position, to release the side switch arm
one notch, and the side switch, therefore, moves into its second position.</p>

<p><i>Second Position of Side Switch.</i> It is principally in this second
position of the side switch that the connector selecting function differs
from that of the first and the second selector. There is no trunk
to be hunted, but rather the rotary movement of the connector wipers
must be made in response to the impulses, from the subscriber's
station, which correspond to the units digit in the selected number.
The first impulse corresponding to the fourth movement of the subscriber's
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Page 190]</a></span>dial is a rotary one, and, as usual, it passes through the rotary
relay winding and this, in turn, gives an impulse to the private
magnet. The private magnet at this time has already released the
side switch arm to its second position, but it is unable to release it
further because of a feather on the wiper shaft&mdash;which projects just
far enough to engage the lug <i>5'</i>, when the shaft is in its normal
angular position&mdash;thus preventing the side switch arm from moving farther
than its second position.</p>

<p>Then follows over the vertical side of the line the last set of
selecting impulses corresponding to the units digit. This, as before,
energizes the vertical relay, but in the second position of the side
switch, it is to be noted, that the vertical relay no longer controls the
vertical magnet; the side switch has shifted the control of the vertical
relay to the rotary magnet. The rotary magnet is, therefore, energized
a number of times corresponding to the last digit in the called
number and the wipers of the connectors are thus brought to the contacts
of the line sought&mdash;their final goal. At this point many things
may happen, and the things that do happen depend on whether
the called subscriber's line is idle or busy.</p>

<p>Called-Line Busy:&mdash;It will first be assumed that the called
line is busy. The testing operation at the connectors occurs in the
second position of the side switch. If the called line is busy, it will
be either because it is connected to by some other connector or because
it has itself made a call. In the former case the private contacts
of that line in the banks of all the connectors serving that
hundreds group of lines will be grounded through the private wiper
of some other connector. That this is so, may be seen by tracing
the circuit from the private wiper on the shaft to the third side switch
wiper which is grounded in the third position; the other connector
that has already engaged the line will, of course, have its side switch
in its final, or third position. Again, if the line called is busy, because
a call has already been made from this line to some other
line, the private contacts on the connectors corresponding to the line
will be grounded, as will be seen by tracing from the private bank
contacts, which are shown in Fig. 396, through the private wire to the
line switch, which is shown in Fig. 389, and from thence to ground
through the springs <i>19</i> and <i>20</i>, which are brought together when the
line switch is operated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Page 191]</a></span></p><p>In any event, therefore, the determining condition of a busy
line is that its private bank contacts on all connectors of its group
shall be grounded. Under the present assumed condition, therefore,
the connector wipers, which have been brought to the bank contacts
of the desired line, will find a ground at the private bank contact.
The connector shaft stops for an instant on the contacts of this busy
line and immediately there follows over the rotary side of the line
the inevitable single rotary impulse. This energizes the rotary relay
and this, as usual, energizes the private magnet. Remembering now
that the connector side switch is in its second position and that the
private wiper of the connector has found a ground, we may trace
back from the private wiper through the third side switch wiper to
its second contact; thence through the contact springs <i>14</i> and <i>15</i>,
closed by the private magnet; thence through the release magnet;
thence through the contact springs <i>16</i> and <i>17</i> of the calling battery
supply relay to the live side of the battery. This calling battery
supply relay will, at this time, have its core energized because the
coil <i>18</i> is in series with the rotary relay coil which, as just stated,
was energized by the last rotary impulse. This series of operations
has led to the energizing of the release magnet, and, as a result, the
double dog of the connector is pulled out of the connector shaft
ratchets and the shaft and the side switch are restored to their
normal position.</p>

<p>Busy-Back Signal:&mdash;The connector has dropped back to
normal in all respects. The calling subscriber, not knowing this,
presses his ringing button. This grounds the vertical side of the line
at his station and operates the vertical relay at the connector. This
steps the shaft of the connector up one step and causes the closure
of the contacts <i>19</i> and <i>20</i> at the top of the connector shaft. This
establishes a connection to a circuit carrying periodically interrupted
battery current on which an inductive hum is placed. This circuit
may be traced from this source through the springs <i>20</i> and <i>19</i> to
the first wiper of the side switch, thence through the normally closed
contacts of the ringing relay to the rotary side of the line, and the
varying potential to which this path is subjected produces an inductive
flow back to the calling subscriber's telephone, and gives
him the necessary signal which consists of a hum or buzzing noise
with which all users of automatic systems soon become familiar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Page 192]</a></span></p><p>Release on Busy Connection:&mdash;The connector, since its last
release, has been stepped up one notch and must again be released.
When the subscriber hangs up his receiver after receiving the busy
signal, he grounds both sides of his line momentarily by the
action of the springs <i>21</i>, <i>22</i>, and <i>23</i> of Fig. 384. This operates the
rotary and the vertical relays on the connector simultaneously and
brings together for the first time the springs <i>21</i> and <i>22</i> of Fig. 396.
This establishes a connection from the battery through the springs
<i>16</i> and <i>17</i> on the calling battery supply relay, thence through the
release magnet of the connector, thence through the springs <i>22</i> and
<i>21</i> of the vertical and the rotary relay, thence through the release
trunk back to the second selector. From here the circuit passes
through the private wiper of that selector and the back release relay
to ground through the third side switch wiper which is in the third
position. Considering this circuit in respect to its action on the connector
it is obvious that it energizes the release magnet on the connector
which restores the connector to normal as before. At the
second selector this circuit passed through the back release relay, which
closed a circuit through the release magnet and through the back release
relay contacts, thence back over the second selector release trunk
to the back release relay of the first selector, and through the third
wiper of the side switch on that selector to ground, since that side
switch also is in its third position. The current through this circuit
energizes the release magnet of the second selector and restores it to
its normal position and also energizes the back release relay of the
first selector. This, in turn, closes the circuit from the battery
through the release magnet of the first selector and contacts of the
back release relay to ground. This works the release magnet of
the first selector and restores that selector to normal. The contacts
on the first selector release magnet, shown in Fig. 390, are closed by
the action of the release magnet and this closes the path from ground
back through the first selector release wire, and through the contacts
<i>13</i> and <i>14</i> of the line switch, through the line switch release magnet
to battery, and this restores the line switch to normal.</p>

<p>The reason for the term <i>back release</i> will now be apparent. The
release operation at the connector is relayed back to the second selector;
that of the second selector back to the first selector; and that
of the first selector back to the line switch. Until this plan was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Page 193]</a></span>adopted, the release magnet of each selector and connector involved
in a connection was left bridged across the talking circuit so as to
be available for release; and it sometimes occurred that a first selector
would be released before a second selector or connector, which
latter switches would thus be left off-normal until rescued by an
attendant. The back release plan makes it impossible for the connection
necessary for the release of a switch to be torn down until
the release is actually accomplished.</p>

<p>Called Line Found Idle:&mdash;It will be remembered that, before
the digression necessary to trace through the operations occurring
upon the finding of a busy line, the connector wipers had been
brought, by the influence of the calling subscriber's impulses, into
engagement with the contacts of the desired line; that the connector
side switch was in its second position; and that the final rotary impulse
following the last series of selecting impulses had not been
sent. The condition now to be assumed is that the called subscriber's
line is free and the private wiper, therefore, has found and rests on an
ungrounded private bank contact. The final rotary impulse which
immediately follows will operate the rotary relay and this, in turn,
will operate the private magnet. This happened under the assumed
condition that the line was busy, but in that case the release magnet
was also operated at the same time and restored all conditions to
normal. Under the present condition the operation of the private
magnet will perform its usual function and move the side switch
of the connector into its third position.</p>

<p><i>Third Position of Side Switch.</i> When the side switch of the
connector moves to its third position, it, as usual, cuts the talking
circuit straight through from the vertical and the rotary sides of the
trunk leading from the previous selector to the outgoing terminal
of the subscriber's line, which may be traced upon Fig. 396 back
through the line switch, shown in Fig. 389. Several things are to be
noted about the talking circuit so established: First, the inclusion
of the condensers in the vertical and the rotary sides of the connector
circuit. The purpose of this will be referred to later. Second,
the inclusion in this circuit at the connector of a pair of normally
closed contacts in the ringing relay. It may be said in passing that
the ringing relay corresponds exactly in function to a ringing key
in a manual switchboard. Third, the talking circuit leading from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Page 194]</a></span>the connector to the called subscriber's line passes on one side through
the springs <i>24</i> and <i>25</i> of the bridge cut-off relay of the line switch,
which is shown in Fig. 389. These springs are normally open and
would prevent the completion of the talking circuit but for the fact
that the bridge cut-off relay of the line switch is energized over the
private wire leading to the connector bank and then through the
connector wiper to the third side switch wiper which, at this time, is
in its third position. The talking circuit is thus complete. The
operation of this bridge cut-off relay on the line switch has not only
completed the talking circuit but it has also opened the circuit of
the trip magnet of the line switch so as to prevent the operation of
the trip magnet by the subscriber on that line in case he should attempt
to make a call during the interval between the time when his
line was connected with by the connector and the time when he answers
the call.</p>

<p>The third wiper of the connector side switch when moved into
its third position, puts the ground on all of the private bank contacts
of the line chosen and thus guards that line against connection by
others, as already described. It also operates the bridge cut-off
relay of the line switch as just mentioned.</p>

<p>The fourth wiper of the side switch, when moved into its third
position, establishes such a connection as will place the ringing relay
under the control of the vertical relay. This may be seen by
tracing from ground to the vertical relay springs <i>23</i> and <i>24</i>,
thence through the normally closed upper pair of contacts on the
private magnet, thence through the fourth wiper on the side switch
to its third contact, thence through the ringing relay magnet, and
through the springs <i>16</i> and <i>17</i> of the calling battery supply relay
and to battery. The calling battery supply relay winding being in
series with the vertical relay winding, the two operate together and
close the two normally open points in the ringing relay circuit. This
ringing relay acts as an ordinary ringing key and connects the generator
to the called subscriber's line in an obvious manner, at the
same time opening the talking circuit back of the ringing relay in
order to prevent the ringing current chattering the relays in the circuit
back of it. All that remains now is for the called subscriber
to respond. When he does he closes the metallic circuit of the line
through his talking apparatus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Page 195]</a></span></p><p><i>Battery Supply to Connected Subscriber.</i> Throughout the
whole process of building up a connection, it will be remembered
that both sides of the calling line are connected through the respective
vertical and rotary relays involved in building up the connection
with the live side of the battery. At the time when the connection
is finally established and the called subscriber rung, both
sides of the calling line are connected through various relay windings
to the live side of the battery. Such a condition leaves both sides of
the line at the same potential and, therefore, there is no tendency
for current to flow through the calling subscriber's talking apparatus,
even though it is connected across the circuit of the line. It remains,
therefore, to be seen how these conditions are so changed
after the building up of a connection as to supply the calling subscriber
with talking current.</p>

<p>The calling subscriber can get no current until the called subscriber
responds. When the connection is first made with the called
subscriber's line, battery connection to his line is made from the live
side of battery through the normally closed contacts of the calling
battery supply relay, thence through the winding <i>25</i> of the called
battery supply relay to the vertical side of the called line. The
grounded side of the battery is connected to the rotary side of his
line through the third wiper of the connector and the coil <i>26</i> of the
called battery supply relay. As a result, this subscriber receives
proper talking current through the coils <i>25</i> and <i>26</i>, and this relay
is operated by the flow of this current. The operation of this called
battery supply relay merely shifts the connection of the rotary side
of the calling subscriber's line from its normal battery connection,
to ground, and thus the battery is placed straight across the calling
subscriber's line so as to supply talking current. This supply circuit
to the calling subscriber may be traced from the live side of
the battery through the winding <i>13</i> of the calling battery supply relay
and the winding of the vertical relay to the vertical side of the line,
and from the grounded side of battery through the third side switch
wiper in its third position to the now closed pair of contacts in the
called battery supply relay through the coil <i>18</i> of the calling battery
supply relay and the coil of the rotary relay to the rotary side of
the line.</p>

<p>It will be noted that the system of battery supply is that of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Page 196]</a></span>standard condenser and retardation coil scheme largely employed
in manual practice; and that aside from the coils through which
the battery current is supplied to the connected subscribers, there are
no taps from, or bridges across, the two sides of the talking circuit.</p>

<p><b>Release after Conversation.</b> It remains now only to secure
the disconnection of the subscribers after they are through talking.
When the calling subscriber hangs up, the whole disconnection
is brought about, all of the apparatus, including connector,
selectors, and line switch, returning to normal. This is done by
the back release system and is accomplished in almost the same
way as has already been described in connection with the disconnect
after an unsuccessful call. There is this difference, however:
after an unsuccessful call when the line called for was found busy,
the release was made while the connector side switch was in its
normal position. In the present case, the release must be made
with the connector side switch in its third position and with the
talking battery bridged across the metallic circuit rather than connected
between each limb of the line and ground. It must be
remembered that the calling battery supply relay, while traversed
by current during the conversation, is not magnetically energized
because, with the current flowing through the metallic circuit of the
line, the two windings exert a differential effect. As soon, however,
as the calling subscriber hangs up his receiver, this differential
action ceases, due to the grounding of both sides of the line at the subscriber's
station. This relay, therefore, operates and cuts off battery
from the called battery supply relay and this, in turn, releases
its armature and thus changes the connection of the rotary side of the
calling line from ground to live side of the battery. The normal
condition of the battery connection now being restored, both the
vertical and the rotary relays at the connector become operated, due
to the ground on both sides of the line at the subscriber's station, and
this, as we have seen, is the condition which brings about the operation
of the connector release magnet, and the relaying back of the
disconnect impulse successively through the selectors to the line
switch.</p>

<p><b>Multi-Office System.</b> In exchanges involving more than one
office, the same general principles and mode of operation already
outlined apply. If the total number of subscribers in the multi-office
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Page 197]</a></span>exchange is to be less than ten thousand, then four digit numbers
suffice, and the first movement of the dial may be made to select
the office into which the connection is to go, the subscribers' lines
being so numbered with respect to the offices that each office will
contain only certain thousands. The choosing of the thousand by
the calling subscriber, therefore, takes care in itself of the choice of
offices. Where, however, a multi-office exchange is to provide for
connections among a greater number of lines than ten thousand and
less than one hundred thousand, then it will take five movements of
the dial to make the selection&mdash;the five movements corresponding
either to the five digits in a number or to the name of an office, as
indicated on the dial, and the four digits of a smaller number. The
lines may all carry five digit numbers or, what is considered better
practice, may be designated by an office name followed by a four
digit number. In this latter case the numbers of the subscribers'
lines will in each case be contained in one or more of the tens of thousands
groups, no number having more than four digits. And the
first movement of the dial, whether the name or number plan be
adopted, will select an office; or, looking at it another way, will select
a group of ten thousand and this being done, the next four successive
movements of the dial will select the numbers in that ten
thousand in just the some way that has been already described.</p>

<p>Certain difficulties arise, however, in multi-office working
due to the fact that the three-wire trunks between offices would
in most cases be objectionable. As long as the trunks extend
between the various groups of apparatus in the same office, it is cheaper
to provide three wires for each of them than it is to make any additional
complication in the apparatus. Where the trunking is done
between offices, however, the system may be so modified as to work
over two wire inter-office trunks.</p>

<p><i>The Trunk Repeater.</i> The purpose of the trunk repeater is
to enable the inter-office trunking to be done over two wires. It
may be said that the trunk repeater is a device placed in the outgoing
trunk circuit at the office in which a call originates, which will do
over the two wires of the trunk leading from it to the distant office
just the same thing that the subscriber's signal transmitter does
over the two wires of the subscriber's lines. It has certain other
functions in regard to feeding the battery for talking purposes back
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Page 198]</a></span>to the calling subscriber's line, taking the place in this respect of the
calling battery feed relay in the connector in a single office exchange.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig397_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 397. Circuits of Trunk Repeater</b><br />
<a href="images/fig397.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The circuits of a trunk repeater are shown in Fig. 397. In considering
it, it must be understood that the three wires entering the
figure at the left are the vertical, rotary, and release wires of a second
selector trunk leading from the first selector banks in the same
office. The two wires leading from the right of the figure are those
extending to the distant office, and terminate there in second selectors.
The vertical and the rotary sides of this trunk as shown at
the left will receive the impulses from the subscriber's station coming
through the line switch and the first selector, as usual. The
vertical impulses will pass through the winding of the vertical relay
and through the winding <i>1</i> of the calling battery supply relay and
thence to battery, the same as on a connector. These impulses
will work the armatures of both of these relays in unison. The
movements of the vertical relay armature in response to these impulses
will cause corresponding impulses to flow over a circuit which
may be traced from ground, through the springs <i>3</i> and <i>2</i> of the vertical
relay, the springs <i>4</i> and <i>5</i> of the bridged relay <i>6</i> and thence to the
vertical side of the trunk and to the distant office, where it passes into
a second selector and through its vertical relay to battery. Thus
the vertical impulses are passed on over the two-wire trunk to the
second selector at the distant office. It becomes necessary, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Page 199]</a></span>to prevent these impulses from passing back through the winding
of the bridge relay <i>6</i> and this is done by means of the sluggish
relay <i>7</i>. This relay receives local battery impulses in unison with
those sent over the trunk by the vertical relay, these being supplied
from the battery at the local office through the contacts <i>8</i> and <i>9</i> of
the calling battery supply relay, which works in unison with the
vertical relay. These rapidly recurring impulses are too fast for
the sluggish relay <i>7</i> to follow. And this relay merely pulls up its
armature and cuts off both sides of the trunk leading back to the first
selector. The rotary impulses are repeated to the rotary side of
the two-wire trunk in a similar way.</p>

<p>Considering now the operation of the trunk repeater in the reverse
direction, the action of the bridging relay <i>6</i> is of vital importance.
Normally both sides of trunk line are connected to the live
side of the battery and, therefore, there is no difference of potential
between them and no tendency to operate the bridged relay. When
the connection has been fully established to the subscriber at the
distant office, and that subscriber has responded, the action of his
battery supply relay will, as before stated, change the connection
of the rotary side of the line from battery to ground, and thus bridge
the battery at the distant exchange across the trunk. This action
will pull up the bridged relay <i>6</i> at the trunk repeater and will perform
exactly the same function with respect to the connection of the battery
with the calling subscriber's line. In other words, it will change
the connection of the rotary side of the calling line from battery to
ground, thus establishing the necessary difference in potential to give
the calling subscriber the necessary current for transmission purposes.
The disconnect feature is about the same as already described.
When the calling subscriber hangs up his receiver both the vertical
and rotary relays of the trunk repeater operate, which places the
ground on both sides of the two-wire trunk to the distant office,
which is the condition for releasing all of the apparatus there.</p>

<p>For the purpose of convenience the simplified diagram of Fig.
398 has been prepared, which shows the complete connection from
a calling subscriber to a called subscriber in a multi-office exchange,
wherein the first movement of the dial is employed to establish the
connection to the proper office and the four succeeding movements
to make a selection among ten thousand lines in that office. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Page 200]</a></span>circuit, therefore, employs at the first office the line switch, the
first selector, and the trunk repeater; and at the second office the
second selector, third selector, connector, and line switch.</p>

<p>The third selector is omitted from Fig. 398, but this will cause
no confusion, since it is exactly like the second selector. The circuits
shown are exactly like those previously described but in drawing
them the main idea has been to simplify the connections to the
greatest possible extent at a sacrifice in the clearness with which
the mechanical inter-relation of parts is shown. No correct understanding
of the circuits of an automatic system is possible without
a clear idea of the mechanical functions performed by the different
parts, and, therefore, we have described what are apparently the
more complex circuit drawings first.
It is believed that the student, in attempting
to gain an understanding
of this marvel of mechanical and electrical
intricacy, will find his task less
burdensome if he will refer freely to
both the simplified circuit drawing of
Fig. 398 and the more complex ones
preceding it. By doing so he will
often be enabled to clear up a doubtful
circuit point from the simpler diagram
and a doubtful mechanical point
from those diagrams which represent
more clearly the mechanical relation of
parts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Page 201]</a></span></p><p><b>Automatic Sub-Offices.</b> Obviously, the system of trunking employed
in automatic exchanges lends itself with great facility to the
subdivision of an exchange into a large number of comparatively
small office districts and the establishment of branch offices or sub-offices
at the centers of these districts.</p>

<p>The trunking between large offices has already been described.
An attractive feature of the automatic system is the establishment
of so-called sub-stations or sub-offices. Where there is, in an outlying
district, a distinct group of subscribers whose lines may readily
be centered at a common point within that district and where the
number of such subscribers and lines is insufficient to establish a
fully equipped office, it is possible to
establish a so-called sub-station or sub-office
connected with the main office
of that district by trunk lines. At
this sub-office there are placed only
line switches and connectors. When a
call is originated on one of these sub-office
lines, the line switch acts instantly
to connect that line with one
of the trunks leading to the main
office of that district, at which this
trunk terminates in a first selector.
From there on, the connection is the
same as that in a system in which
no sub-offices are employed. Calls
coming into this sub-office over trunk
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Page 202]</a></span>lines from the main office are received on the connectors at the
sub-office and the connection is made with the sub-office line by
the connector in the usual manner. This arrangement, it is seen,
amounts merely to a stretching of the connector trunks for a given
group of lines so that they will reach out from a main office to a sub-office,
it being more economical to lengthen the smaller number of
trunks and by so doing to decrease in length the larger number of
subscribers' lines.</p>

<p><b>The Rotary Connector.</b> For certain purposes it becomes
desirable in automatic work to employ a special form of connector
which will have in itself a certain ability to make automatic selection
of one of a group of previously chosen trunks in much the same
manner as the first and second selectors automatically choose the
first idle one of a group of trunks.</p>

<p>Such a use is demanded in private branch-exchange working where
a given business establishment, for instance, has a plurality of lines
connecting its own private switchboard with the central office. The
directory number of all these lines is, for convenience, made the same,
and it is important, therefore, that when a person attempts to make
a connection with this establishment, he will not fail to get his connection
simply because the first one of these lines happens to be busy.
For such use a given horizontal row of connector terminals or a part
of such a row is assigned to the lines leading to the private branch
exchange and the connector is so modified as to have a certain "discretionary"
power of its own. As a result, when the common number
of all these lines is called, the connector will choose the first one,
if it is not already engaged by some other connector, but if it is, it
will pass on to the next, and so on until an idle one is found. It is
only when the connector has hunted through the entire group of
lines and found them all busy that it will refuse to connect and will
give the busy signal to the calling subscriber.</p>

<p><b>Party Lines.</b> The description of this system as given above
has been confined entirely to direct line working; however, party
lines may be and are frequently employed.</p>

<p>The circuits and apparatus used with direct lines are, with slight
modifications, applicable to use with party lines.</p>

<p>The harmonic method of ringing is employed and the stations
are so arranged with respect to the connectors that those requiring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Page 203]</a></span>the same frequency for ringing the bells are in groups served by
the same set of connectors.</p>

<p>The party lines are operated on the principle commonly
known in manual practice as the jack per station arrangement.
Each party line will, therefore, have sets of terminals appearing in
separate hundreds; the connectors associated with each of these
hundreds being so arranged as to impress the proper frequency of
ringing current on the line.</p>

<p>From the subscribers' standpoint the operation is the same as
for direct lines, as the particular hundreds digit of a number serves
to select one of a group of connectors
capable of connecting the
proper ringing current to the line.</p>

<p>To avoid confusion, which
would be caused by a subscriber
on a party line attempting to make
a call when the line is already in
use by some other subscriber, the
subscribers' stations are so arranged
that when the line is in
use all other stations on the line
are locked out.</p>

<p><b>The Two-Wire Automatic System.</b> The two-wire system that has
recently been introduced by the Automatic Electric Company brings
about the very important result of accomplishing all of the automatic
switching over metallic circuit lines without the use of ground
or common returns. The system is thus relieved of the disturbing
influences to which the three-wire system is sometimes subjected,
due to differences in earth potential between various portions of
the system, which may add to or subtract from the battery potential
and alter the net potential available between two distant points.
The introduction of this system has also made possible certain other
incidental features of advantage, one of which is a great simplification
and reduction in size of the subscriber's station signal-transmitting
apparatus.</p>

<p>With the doing away of the ground as a return circuit, it becomes
impossible to send vertical impulses over one side of the line and to
follow them by single rotary impulses over the other side of the line.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Page 204]</a></span>Yet it becomes necessary to distinguish between the pure selective
impulses and those impulses which dictate a change of function at
the central office. The plan has, therefore, been adopted of accomplishing
the selection in each case by short and rapidly recurring
impulses and of accomplishing those functions formerly brought
about by the single impulse over the rotary side of the line by a pause
between the respective series of
selective impulses. This is accomplished
at the central office
by replacing the vertical and the
rotary relays of the three-wire
system by a quick-acting and a
sluggish relay, respectively; the
quick-acting relay performing
the functions previously carried
out by the vertical relay, and
the sluggish relay acting only
during the pauses between the
successive series of quick impulses
to do the things formerly
done by the rotary relay. This
has resulted in a delightful simplification
of subscriber's apparatus,
since it is now necessary
only to provide a device which
will connect the two sides of the
line together the required number of times in quick succession and
then allow a pause with the circuit closed while the subscriber is
getting ready to transmit another set of impulses corresponding to
another digit. The calling device has no mechanical function co-acting
with any of the other parts of the telephone and may be
considered as a separate mechanical device electrically connected
with the line. The transmitting device is not much larger than
a large watch and a good idea of it may be had from Fig. 399,
which shows the latest wall set, and Fig. 400, which shows the latest
desk set of the Automatic Electric Company. We regret the fact
that this company has made the request that the complete details
of their two-wire system be not published at this time.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXX" id="CHAPTER_XXX"></a>CHAPTER XXX<br />

<span style="font-size:80%;">THE LORIMER AUTOMATIC SYSTEM</span></h2>


<p>The Lorimer automatic telephone system has not been commercially
used in this country but is in commercial operation in a
few places in Canada. It is interesting from several points of view.
It was invented, built, and installed by the Lorimer Brothers&mdash;Hoyt,
George William, and Egbert&mdash;of Brantford, Ontario. These young
men without previous telephonic training and, according to their
statements, without ever having seen the inside of a telephone office,
conceived and developed this system and put it in practical operation.
With the struggles and efforts of these young men in accomplishing
this feat we have some familiarity, and it impresses us as one of the
most remarkable inventive achievements that has come to our attention,
regardless of whatever the merits or demerits of the system may be.</p>

<p>The Lorimer system is interesting also from the fact that, in
most cases, it represents the mechanical rather than the electrical
way of doing things. The switches are power driven and electrically
controlled rather than electrically driven and electrically controlled,
as in the system of the Automatic Electric Company.</p>

<p>The subscriber's station apparatus consists of the usual receiver,
speech transmitter, call bell, and hook switch, and in addition a
signal transmitter arranged to be manipulated by the subscriber
so as to control the operation of the central-office apparatus in connecting
with any desired line in the system.</p>

<p>The central-office apparatus is designed throughout upon the
principle of switching by means of power-driven switches which are
under the control of the signal transmitters of the calling subscriber's
station. The switches employed in making a connection are all so
arranged with respect to constantly rotating shafts that the movable
member of such switches may be connected to the shafts by means
of electromagnets controlled directly or indirectly by relays, which,
in turn, are brought under the control of the signal transmitters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Page 206]</a></span></p><p>The circuits are so designed in many instances that the changes
necessary for the different steps are brought about by the movement
of the switches themselves, thus permitting the use of circuits which
are rather simple. The switches employed are all of a rotary type;
the co-ordinate selection, which is accomplished in the Automatic
Electric Company's system by a vertical and rotary movement, being
brought about in this system by the independent rotation of two
switches.</p>

<p><b>Subscriber's Station Equipment.</b> A subscriber's desk-stand
set, except the call bell, is shown in Fig. 401, and a wall set complete
in Fig. 402. In both of these illustrations may be seen the familiar
transmitter, receiver, and hook switch, and
in the wall set, the call bell. The portion of
these telephone sets which is unfamiliar at
present is the part which is enclosed in the
enlarged base of the desk stand and the
protruding device below the speech transmitter
in the wall set&mdash;the signal transmitter
referred to earlier in the chapter. The small
push button and small plate through which
the number may be seen directly below the
transmitter in Fig. 402, are for the purpose
of registering calls.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig401_t.jpg" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 401. Lorimer Automatic Desk Stand</b><br />
<a href="images/fig401.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The signal transmitter is a device whose
function is to record mechanically the number
of the subscriber's station with which
connection is desired, and to transmit that
record to the central office by a system of
electrical impulses over the line conductors. Instead of operating
by its own initiative, the signal transmitter is adapted to respond
to central-office control in transmitting electrically the number which
has been recorded mechanically upon it.</p>

<p>The signal transmitter shown removed from the base of the desk
stand at the left in Fig. 403 comprises in part four sets of contact
pins having ten pins in each set, one set for each of the digits of a four-digit
number. There are also several additional contact pins for
signaling and auxiliary controlling purposes. All of these contact
pins are arranged upon the circumference of a circle and a movable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Page 207]</a></span>brush mounted upon a shaft at the center of the circle is adapted to be
rotated by a clock spring and to make contact with each of the pins
successively. The call is started, after the number desired has been
set on the dial, by giving
the crank at the right of the
signal transmitter a complete
turn and thus winding the
spring. The shaft carrying
the signal transmitter brush
carries also an escapement
wheel, the pallet of which is
directly controlled by an
electromagnet.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig402_t.jpg" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 402. Lorimer Automatic Wall Set</b><br />
<a href="images/fig402.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The four dials with the
numerals printed on them are
attached to four levers, respectively,
and are moved by
their levers opposite windows,
near the top of the casing.
Through each of these windows
a single numeral may
be seen on the corresponding
one of the dials. The dials
may be adjusted so that the four numerals seen will read from left
to right to correspond to the number of the line with which connection
is desired.</p>

<p>The setting of the dials so that the number desired shows at the
small circular opening results in connecting the earth or a common
return conductor to one pin of each set of ten pins, the pin grounded
in each set depending upon the numerical value of the digit for which
the dial is set.</p>

<p>The circle of contact pins is set in an insulating disk, the signal
transmitting brush operates upon the pins on one side of the disk,
and electrical fingers attached to the dials operate upon the
pins on the other side of the disk. The escapement wheel is a
single toothed disk attached directly to the shaft which carries the
signal brush and its pallet is attached rigidly to the magnet armature.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Page 208]</a></span></p>
<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 403. Desk Stand with Signal Transmitter Removed</b><br />

<p>Once a call has been turned in, the entire subscriber's station
equipment is locked beyond power of the subscriber to tamper
with it in any way, rendering it impossible either to defeat the call
which has been started or to prevent the subscriber's station as a
whole from returning completely to normal position and thus restoring
itself for regular service. The key shown just below the
signal transmitter in the case of the desk stand, and at the right in
the wall set, is for the purpose of operating a relay at the central
office which, in turn, connects ringing current to the line of the subscriber
with which connection has been made, and thus actuates the
call bell.</p>

<p>As the number set up at the signal transmitter remains in full
view until reset for some other number, it is easily checked by inspection
and also lessens the labor involved in making a second call
for the same line, which is frequently necessary when the line is
found busy the first time called.</p>

<p><b>Central-Office Apparatus.</b> The subscriber's lines are divided
into groups of one hundred lines each at the central office,
each group being served by a single unit of central-office apparatus.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Page 209]</a></span>In a central-office unit there is "sectional apparatus" which appears
but once for the unit of one hundred lines; "divisional apparatus"
which appears a number of times for each unit, depending upon
the traffic; and "line apparatus" which appears one hundred times
for each unit or once for each line.</p>

<p>The sectional apparatus comprises devices whose duties are,
first, to detect a calling line, and second, to assign to the calling
line a set of idle divisional apparatus which serves to perform the
necessary switching functions and complete the connection.</p>

<p>The sets of divisional apparatus, or, as called in this system,
"divisions," are common to a section and are employed in a manner
similar to the connecting cords of a manual switchboard. The
number of these divisions provided for each section is, therefore,
determined by the number of simultaneous connections resulting
from calls originating in the section. It has been the custom in
building this apparatus to provide each section with seven divisions
or connective elements.</p>

<p>The line apparatus comprises one relay, having a single winding,
and two pairs of contacts operated by its armature. This device
is substantially the well known cut-off relay almost universally
employed in common-battery systems. The fixed multiple contacts
of the lines in the switching banks of the connecting apparatus are
considered as pertaining to the various pieces of apparatus on which
they are found rather than to their respective lines. A good idea may
be obtained of the arrangement of the sectional and divisional apparatus
by referring to Fig. 404, which is one unit of a thousand-line
equipment. The apparatus in the vertical row at the extreme left
of the illustration is the sectional apparatus, while the remaining
seven vertical rows of apparatus are the divisions.</p>

<p><i>The Section.</i> The sectional apparatus for each unit consists
of three separate devices called for convenience a <i>decimal indicator</i>, a
<i>division starter</i>, and a <i>decimal-register controller</i>. All of these devices
are normally motionless when idle. The energization of the decimal
indicator, in response to the inauguration of a call at a subscriber's
station, results immediately in an action of the division starter
which starts a division to connect with the line calling. It results
also in the starting of the decimal-register controller, the remaining
unit of sectional apparatus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Page 210]</a></span></p><p>It is thus seen that upon the starting of a call by a subscriber,
all of the sectional apparatus belonging to his one hundred lines
immediately becomes active, the division starter acting to start a
division, the decimal indicator becoming energized to indicate the
tens group in which the call has appeared, and the decimal-register
controller becoming active to adjust the decimal register of the
division assigned by the division starter. The division starter having
assigned a division for the exclusive use of this particular call,
passes to a position from which it may start a similar idle division
when the next call is received. The decimal register controller
makes its half revolution for the call and comes to rest, awaiting a
subsequent call, and the decimal indicator continues energized but
only momentarily, since it is released by the action of the cut-off relay
when the call is taken in charge by the divisional connective devices.</p>

<p>Calls may follow each other rapidly, the connective devices being
entirely independent of each other after having been assigned to the
respective calling lines. As has been described, the decimal indicator
starts the division starter and the decimal-register controller
in quick succession. The division starter, shown at the extreme
bottom of the left-hand row of Fig. 404, is a cylinder switch of the
same general type as used throughout this system. In it the terminals
of a switch in each division appear as fixed contact points in a
circle over which move the brushes of the division starter.</p>

<p>The decimal-register controller has the duties of transmitting
to the divisional apparatus a series of current impulses corresponding
in number to the numerical value of the tens digit of the calling
line. This is effected by providing before a movable brush ten contacts
from which the brush may receive current. These contacts
are normally not connected to battery, so that the brush in passing
over them does not receive current from them; however, when the
brush has reached the contact corresponding in number to the tens
digit of the calling line, a relay associated with the decimal-register
controller charges the contacts with the potential of the main battery,
and each of the remaining contacts passed over by the brush
sends a current impulse to a device designed to indicate on the
division selected for the call the tens digit of the calling line.</p>

<p><i>The Connective Division.</i> The connective division, seven of
which are shown in Fig. 404, is an assemblage of switches comprising,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Page 211]</a></span>as a whole, a set suitable for a complete connection from calling to
called subscriber. Each connective division in the unit illustrated
is completely equipped to care for a called number of three digits,
<i>i. e.</i>, each division will connect its calling line with any one of one
thousand lines which may be called. By a system of interconnecting
between divisions, each division may be equipped with interconnecting
apparatus so as to make it possible to complete a call with any
one of ten thousand lines. Each connecting division of a ten-thousand-line
exchange comprises six major switches. Of the six major
switches, one is termed a <i>secondary connector</i>, another an <i>interconnector</i>,
and the four remaining are termed the <i>primary portion</i> of
the division.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig404_t.jpg" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 404. Unit of Switching Apparatus</b><br />
<a href="images/fig404.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Before taking up the operation of the switches, the mechanical
nature of the switches themselves will be described. The switches
are built with a contact bank cylindrical in form and with internal
movable brushes traveling in a rotary manner in circular paths upon
horizontal rows of contacts fixed in the cylindrical banks. For driving
these brushes a constantly rotating main power-driven shaft is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Page 212]</a></span>provided. Between each shaft and the rotating brushes of each
major switch is an electric clutch, which, by the movement of an
armature, causes the brushes of the switch to partake of the motion
of the shaft and by the return of the armature to come again to rest.
The motion of the brushes of the major switches, or cylinder switches,
as they are frequently called because of their form, is constantly
in the same direction. They have a normal position upon a set of
the cylinder contacts. They leave their normal position and take
any predetermined position as controlled by the magnets of the clutch,
and, having served the transient purpose, they return to their normal
position by traversing the remainder of their complete revolution
and stopping in their position of rest or idleness.</p>

<p>The mechanical construction of each of the cylinder switches
is such that it may disengage its clutch and bring its brushes to rest
only with the brushes in some one of a number of predetermined
positions. The locations of the brushes in these positions of rest,
or "stop" positions, as they are called, may differ with the different
cylinder switches, according to the nature of the duty required of
the switch, and the total number of stop positions also may vary.
The primary and secondary connectors, the interconnector selectors,
and the interconnectors each have eleven stop positions; the rotary
switch has eight stop positions; the signal-transmitter controller has
but two.</p>

<p>In the six cylinder switches making up a connective division
and required for any conversation, in a ten-thousand-line exchange
some of the switches are set to positions which are determined by the
control of the calling subscriber and represent by their selective positions
the value of some digit of the calling or called subscriber's
number. Others are switches controlling the call in its progress
and controlling the switches responsive to the call. These latter
switches take positions independent of the numbers.</p>

<p>In addition to the major switches, there are upon each division
four minor switches termed <i>registers</i>. Each consists of an arc of
fixed contacts accompanied by a set of brushes which sweep over the
contacts. Instead of being driven by an electromagnet, the register
brushes are placed under tension of a spring which tends at all times
to draw them forward. They are then restrained by an escapement
device similar to a pallet escapement in a clock, the pallet being controlled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Page 213]</a></span>by the register's magnets. When a series of impulses are
received by the register magnets, the pallet is actuated a corresponding
number of times and the register brushes are permitted to move forward
under tension of their powerful propelling spring. Each register
is associated with a major switch, and the register brushes are
engaged by a cam upon the associated major switch, and are restored
to normal position against the tension of their propelling
spring, the force of restoration being obtained from the main shaft.</p>

<p>The electrical clutches which connect and disconnect the movable
brushes of the major switches from the main driving shaft are
controlled in all instances by circuits local to the central office. In
some instances these circuits include relay contacts and are controlled
by a relay. In other instances they are formed solely through switch
contacts. In all cases the control, when from a distance, is received
upon relays suitable for being controlled by the small currents which
are adapted to flow over long lines. In all instances the power for
moving a brush is derived from the main shaft and only the control
of the movement is derived from electromagnets, relays, or other
electric sources. In many instances the clutch circuit is closed
through contacts of its own switch and, therefore, may be closed only
when its switch is in some predetermined position. All of the switches
are mechanically powerful and designed particularly to sustain the
wear of long-continued and oft-repeated usage. This is true also
of the moving parts which carry the brushes and of the journals
sustaining those parts.</p>

<p><i>The Switches of the Connective Division.</i> The six major switches
of the connecting division are as follows:</p>

<p>The Primary Connector:&mdash;The function of this switch is to
connect the conductors of the calling line with the switching
devices of the connective division. Associated with this switch is
a register termed the <i>decimal register</i>. The one hundred lines of
the section are terminated in fixed multiple contacts in the cylinder
switch of the primary connector. The calling line is selected and
connected with by adjusting the decimal register to a position
corresponding to the calling line's tens digit and adjusting the brushes
of the cylinder switch to a position corresponding to the calling line's
unit digit.</p>

<p>The Rotary Switch:&mdash;This is a master switch, or pilot switch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Page 214]</a></span>consisting of a cylinder switch without register. Its duty is the control
of other switches and the completion of circuits formed in part
through other switches. It is the pilot switch and the switch of
initiative and control for the entire connective division.</p>

<p>Signal-Transmitter Controller:&mdash;The primary function of
this switch is the generation of signaling impulses of two classes.
Impulses of the first class pass over central-office circuits only and
are effective upon magnets of the divers major and minor switches;
impulses of the second class pass over a line conductor of the calling
line and are effective upon the signal transmitter at the subscriber's
station. The impulses sent out over the line to the subscriber's
station cause the brush to pass over the contacts and thereby indicate
the numerical values of the various digits set by the dials. This
switch also enters in an important manner into the circuits involved
in the testing of the called line for the busy condition. It is controlled
by the rotary switch.</p>

<p>Interconnector Selector:&mdash;In an exchange using four digits in
the numbers, the register of the interconnector selector is adjusted
in each call to a position corresponding to the numerical value
of the thousands digit of the called number. The cylinder switch
then acts to select an idle trunk. The switch is controlled by the
rotary switch in connection with the signal transmitter controller.</p>

<p>Interconnector:&mdash;This switch is similar to the interconnector
selector in design and in function. It is a cylinder switch with
register. The register is adjusted in each call to a position corresponding
to the numerical value of the hundreds digit of the
number called and the cylinder switch then operates to select an
idle trunk. The switch is controlled by the rotary switch in connection
with the signal transmitter controller.</p>

<p>Secondary Connector:&mdash;This switch contains in its cylinder
bank of contacts the multiple points of one hundred subscribers'
lines and its function is to connect the conductors of the called
line to the conductors of the connective division. This is accomplished
by adjusting the register to correspond to the value of the
tens digit of the line desired and by adjusting the cylinder brushes
to correspond to the value of the units digit of the line. The switch
is controlled by the rotary switch in connection with the signal-transmitter
controller.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Page 215]</a></span></p><p><b>Operation.</b> A brief description of the progress of a call from
its institution to the complete connection and subsequent disconnection
begins with the adjustment of the dial indicators of the telephone
set and the turning of the crank of the signal transmitter one
revolution. This act, performed by the calling subscriber, connects
one of the line conductors to earth. Immediately the decimal indicator
associated with the section in which the calling line terminates
is energized and starts the division starter. The division starter
instantly starts the rotary switch of an idle division. The rotary
switch now starts the decimal-register controller and connects to it
the decimal register of the primary connector of the division selected.</p>

<p>All of the above acts in the central office occur practically simultaneously.
The impulses generated by the controller are effective
upon the decimal register of the started division and, therefore, adjust
that register to a position corresponding to the tens value of the
calling line.</p>

<p>The rotary switch now disconnects the tens register and starts
the cylinder brushes of the primary connector which automatically
stop when they encounter the calling line. At this instant the cut-off
relay of the line is energized and the decimal indicator is released.
The call now is clear of all sectional apparatus and another call
may come through immediately, being assigned in charge of another
idle division.</p>

<p>The total time in which any call is in charge of the sectional
apparatus, <i>i. e.</i>, the total time from the grounding of the line conductor
at the sub-station until the line has been connected with by
the primary connector of some division of that section and the sectional
apparatus has been released by the operation of the cut-off
relay, approximates two-fifths of a second.</p>

<p>The next operation initiated by the rotary switch is the starting
of the signal-transmitter controller of the connective division, which,
in turn, adjusts the register of the interconnector selector to a position
corresponding to the thousands digit of the number of the called
line as indicated by the signal transmitter at the calling station.
This selects an interconnector serving the lines of the selected thousand.</p>

<p>This initial selection being completed the rotary switch readjusts
the circuits of the connective division in such manner that in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Page 216]</a></span>further progress of the signal-transmitter controller, its impulses will
be effective upon the register of the selected interconnector. In this
manner, the register of the interconnector, which may be upon the
same connective division as the rotary switch handling the call,
or which may be the interconnector of some other division, as determined
by the number of the called subscriber, is adjusted to a position
corresponding to the second or hundreds digit of the number
called. The cylinder switch of the interconnector then selects and
appropriates an idle trunk extending to a secondary connector upon
some connective division serving the hundred selected.</p>

<p>The rotary switch again shifts the circuits of the connective
division in such manner that the signal-transmitter controller is effective
upon the secondary connector, both register and cylinder, and
adjusts the register and cylinder, respectively, with their brushes in
contact with the tens and units digits, respectively, of the number of
the called line.</p>

<p>The conductors of the called line now are connected through the
secondary connector, the interconnector, and the interconnector
selector to the rotary switch; the conductors of the calling line are
connected through the primary connector to the rotary switch; thus
completely connecting the lines except at the rotary switch. To effect
the connecting together of the two lines, both rotary switch and
signal-transmitter controller must pass forward into their next positions,
the connection when thus effected being made through conductors
containing a repeating coil and main battery connection for
supplying talking current to the two lines and containing also ringing
and supervisory relays.</p>

<p>The called line is tested to determine if busy during the short
interval in which the rotary switch takes a short step to connect the
calling and the called lines. In this step of the rotary switch the
busy-test relay is connected to the guard wire or busy-test wire of
the called line, and if that line be busy, the relay interferes with the
control exercised by the rotary switch upon the signal-transmitter
controller, and the controller is prevented from taking the step required
to connect the line. Thus, when a busy line is encountered,
the final step of the rotary switch is taken to set up the conversation
conditions, but the signal-transmitter controller does not take its
final step; by this failure of the signal-transmitter controller due to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Page 217]</a></span>the action of the busy-test relay, the calling line is not connected to
the called line but is connected to a busy-back tone generator instead.</p>

<p>Whether the line encountered be busy or idle, the connective
division remains in its condition as then adjusted until the subscriber
hangs his receiver upon the hook switch to obtain disconnection.
The ringing of the bell of the called station is done directly by the
calling subscriber in pressing the ringing key.</p>

<p>The disconnection is effected, when the receiver of the calling
line is hung up, by the supervisory relay in the central office, whose
winding is included in the line circuit, and whose contacts act directly
to start the rotary switch. In disconnecting, the rotary switch
starts the primary and the secondary connectors and thus instantly
releases both the calling and the called lines. Thereafter the rotary
switch in passing from position to position restores switch after switch
of the connective division to normal and finally itself returns to normal
in preparation for its assignment to service in answering a subsequent
call.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXI" id="CHAPTER_XXXI"></a>CHAPTER XXXI<br />

<span style="font-size:80%;">THE AUTOMANUAL SYSTEM</span></h2>


<p>Two systems of telephony are now in common use in this country&mdash;the
manual system and the automatic. With the growth of the
automatic, and the gradually ripening conviction, which is now fully
matured in the minds of most telephone engineers, that automatic
switching is practical, there has been a growing tendency toward
doing automatically many of the things that had previously been
done manually. One of the results of this tendency has been the
production of the <i>automanual</i> system, the invention of Edward E.
Clement, an engineer and patent attorney, of Washington, D. C.
In connection with Mr. Clement's name, as inventor, must be mentioned
that of Charles H. North, whose excellent work as a designer
and manufacturer has contributed much toward the present excellence
of this highly interesting system.</p>

<p><b>Characteristics of System.</b> The name "automanual" is coined
from the two words, automatic and manual, and is intended to suggest
the idea that the system partakes in part of the features of the
automatic system and in part of those of the manual system.</p>

<p>We regret that neither space nor the professional relation which
we have had with the development of this system will permit us to
make public an extended and detailed description of its apparatus
and circuits. Only the general features of the system may, therefore,
be dealt with.</p>

<p>The underlying idea of the automanual system is to relieve the
subscriber of all work in connection with the building up of his connection,
except the asking for it; to complicate the subscriber's
station equipment in no way, it being left the same as in the common-battery
manual system; to do away with manual apparatus, such
as jacks, cords and plugs, at the central office, and to substitute for
it automatic switching apparatus which will be guided in its movements,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Page 219]</a></span>not by the subscriber, but by a very much smaller number
of operators than would be necessary to manipulate a manual switchboard.</p>

<p><b>General Features of Operation.</b> A broad view of the operation
of the system is this. The subscriber desiring to make a call takes
down his receiver, and this causes a lamp to light in front of an
operator. The operator presses a button and is in telephonic communication
with the subscriber. Receiving the number desired,
the operator sets it up on a keyboard in just about the same way
that a typist will set up the letters of a short word on a typewriting
machine. The setting up of the number on the keyboard being accomplished,
the proper condition of control of the associated automatic
apparatus at the central office is established and the operator
has no further connection with the call. The automatic switching
apparatus guided by the conditions set up on the operator's keyboard
proceeds to make the proper selection of trunks and to establish
the proper connections through them to build up a talking
circuit between the calling subscriber and the called and to ring the
called subscriber's bell, or, if his line is found busy, the apparatus
refuses to connect with it and sends a busy signal back to the calling
subscriber. The operator performs no work in disconnecting the
subscribers, that being automatically taken care of when they hang
up their receivers at the close of the conversation.</p>

<p>From the foregoing it will be seen that there is this fundamental
difference between the automatic and the automanual&mdash;the automatic
system dispenses entirely with the central-office operator for
all ordinary switching functions; the automanual employs operators
but attempts to so facilitate their work that they may handle very
many more calls than would be possible in a manual system, and at
the same time secures the advantages of secrecy which the automatic
system secures to its subscribers.</p>

<p><b>Subscriber's Apparatus.</b> One of the main points in the controversy
concerning automatic <i>versus</i> manual systems is whether or
not it is desirable to have the subscriber ask for his connection or
to have him make certain simple movements with his fingers which
will lead to his securing it. The developers of the automanual
system have taken the position that the most desirable way, so far
as the subscriber is concerned, is to let him ask for it. It is probable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Page 220]</a></span>that this point will not be a deciding one in the choice of future systems,
since it already seems to be proven that the subscribers in automatic
systems are willing to go through the necessary movements
to mechanically set up the call. The advantage which the automanual
system shares with the manual, however, in the greater
simplicity of its subscriber's station apparatus, cannot be gainsaid.</p>

<p><b>Operator's Equipment.</b> The general form of the operator's
equipment is shown in Fig. 405. A closer view of the top of one of
the key tables is shown in Fig. 406. As will be seen, the equipment
on each operator's position consists of three separate sets of push-button
keys closely resembling in external appearance the keys of
a typewriter or adding machine. Immediately above each set of
keys are the signal lamps belonging to that set.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Page 221]</a></span></p><p>The operator's keys are arranged in strips of ten, placed <i>across</i>
rather than <i>lengthwise</i> on the key shelf. One of these strips is shown
in Fig. 407. There are as many strips of keys in each set as there
are digits in the subscribers' numbers, <i>i. e.</i>, three in a system having
a capacity of less than one thousand; four in a system of less than
ten thousand; and so on. In addition to the number keys of each
set is a partial row of keys, including what is called a <i>starting key</i> and
also keys for making the party-line selection.</p>

<p>The simplicity of the operator's key equipment is one of its attractive
features. Fig. 408 shows one of the key shelves opened so
as to expose to view all of the apparatus and wiring that is placed
before the operator. The reason for providing more than one key
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Page 222]</a></span>set on each operator's position is, that after a call has been set up on
one key set, a few seconds is required before the automatic apparatus
controlled by the key set can do its work and release the key set ready
for another call. The provision of more than one key set makes it
possible for the operator to start setting up another call on another
key set without waiting for the first to be released by the automatic
apparatus.</p>

<p><b>Automatic Switching Equipment.</b> A general view of the arrangement
of automatic switches in an exchange established by the
North Electric Company at Ashtabula, Ohio, is shown in Fig. 409.
The desk in the foreground is that of the wire chief. This automatic
apparatus consists largely of relays and automatic selecting switches.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Page 223]</a></span>The switches are of the step-by-step type, having vertical and rotary
movements, and an idea of one of them, minus its contact banks, is
given in Fig. 410. The control of the automatic switches by the operator's
key sets is through the medium of a power-driven, impulse-sending
machine. From this machine impulses are taken corresponding
to the numbers of the keys depressed.</p>

<p><b>Automatic Distribution of Calls.</b> A feature of great interest
in this system is the manner in which the incoming calls are distributed
among the operators. From each key set an operator's trunk
is extended to what is called a secondary selector switch, through
which it may be connected
to a primary selector
trunk and calling
line. When a subscriber
calls by taking down
his receiver, his line relay
pulls up and causes
a primary selector switch
to connect his line with
an idle local trunk or
link circuit, at the same
time starting up a secondary
selector switch
which immediately connects
the primary trunk
and the calling line to
an operator's idle key
set. If an operator is
at the time engaged in
setting up a call on a
key set, or if that key
set is still acting to control
the sending of impulses
to the automatic switches, it may be said to be busy, and
it is not selected by this preliminary selecting apparatus in response
to an incoming call. As soon, however, as the necessary impulses
have been taken from the key set by the automatic apparatus, that
key set is released and is again ready to receive a call. In this way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Page 224]</a></span>the calls come before each operator only as that operator is able and
ready to receive them.</p>

<p><b>Setting up a Connection.</b> As soon as the key-set lamp lights,
in response to such an incoming call, the operator presses a listening
button, receives the number from the subscriber, and depresses the
corresponding number buttons on that key set, thereby determining
the numbers in each of the series of impulses to be sent to the selector
and the connector switches to make the desired connection. The
operator repeats this number to the calling subscriber as she sets it
up, and then presses the starting button, whereupon her work is
done so far as that call is concerned. If, upon repeating the call to
the subscriber, the operator finds that she is in error, she may change
the number set up at any time before she has pressed the starting
button.</p>

<p><b>Building up a Connection.</b> The keys so set up determine
the number of impulses that will be transmitted by the impulse-sending
machine to the selector and the connector switches. These
switches, impelled by these impulses, establish the connection if
the line called for is not already connected to. If a party-line station
is called for, the proper station on it will be selectively rung
as determined by the party-line key depressed by the operator. If
the line is found busy, the connector switch refuses to make the connection
and places a busy-back signal on the calling line.</p>

<p><b>Speed in Handling Calls.</b> This necessarily brief outline gives
an idea only of the more striking features of the automanual system.
A study of the rapidity with which calls may be handled in actual
practice shows remarkable results as compared with manual methods
of operating. The operators set up the number keys corresponding
to a called number with the same rapidity that the keys of a
typewriter are pressed in spelling a word. In fact, even greater
speed is possible, since it is noticed that the operators frequently
will depress all of the keys of a number at once, as by a single striking
movement of the fingers. The rapidity with which this is done
defies accurate timing by a stop watch in the hands of an expert.
It is practically true, therefore, that the time consumed by the operator
in handling any one call is that which is taken in getting the
number from the subscriber and in repeating it back to him.</p>

<p>Owing to the difficulty of securing accurate traffic data by
means of a stop watch, an automatic, electrical timing device,
capable of registering seconds and hundredths of a second, has
been used in studying the performance of this system in regular
operation at Ashtabula Harbor. The operators were not informed
that the records were being taken, and the data tabulated represents
the work of two operators in handling regular subscribers' calls.
The figures in Table XI are given by C. H. North as representing the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Page 226]</a></span>total time consumed by the operator from the time her line lamp was
lighted until her work in connection with the call was finished, and it
included, therefore, the pressing of the listening button, the receiving
of the number from the subscriber, repeating it back to him, setting
up the connection on the keys, and pressing the starting key.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the average time for each 100 calls is quite
uniform and is slightly over three seconds. The considerable variation
in the individual calls, ranging from a maximum of 12.40 seconds
down to a minimum of 1.60 seconds, is due almost entirely to the
difference between the subscribers in the speed with which they
can give their numbers. These figures indicate that, in each of the
tests, calls were being handled at the rate of more than one thousand
per hour by each operator.</p>

<p>The test of the subscriber's waiting time, <i>i. e.</i>, the time that he
waited for the operator to answer, for one hundred calls made without
the knowledge of the operator, showed the results as given in
Table XII, in which a split second stop watch was used in making
the observations.</p>

<p>The length of time which the subscriber has to wait before receiving
an answer from the operator is, of course, one of the factors
that enters into the giving of good telephone service, and the times
shown by this test are considerably shorter than ordinarily maintained
in manual practice. The waiting time of the subscriber is
not, of course, a part of the time that is consumed by the operator,
and the real economy so far as the operator's time is concerned is
shown in the tests recorded in Table XI.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII"></a>CHAPTER XXXII<br />

<span style="font-size:80%;">POWER PLANTS</span></h2>


<p>The power plant is an organization of devices to furnish to a telephone
system the several kinds of current, at proper pressures, for the
performance of the several general electrical tasks within the exchange.</p>

<p><b>Kinds of Currents Employed.</b> Sources of both direct and alternating
current are required and a single exchange may employ these
for one or more of the following purposes:</p>

<p><i>Direct Current.</i> Current which flows always in one direction
whether steady or varying, is referred to as direct current, and may
be required for transmitters, for relays, for line, supervisory, and
auxiliary signals, for busy tests, for automatic switches, for call registers,
for telegraphy, and in the form of pulsating current for the
ringing of biased bells.</p>

<p><i>Alternating Current.</i> Sources of alternating current are required
for the ringing of bells, for busy-back and other automatic
signals to subscribers, for howler signals to attract the attention of
subscribers who have left their receivers off their hooks, and for signaling
over composite lines.</p>

<p><b>Types of Power Plants.</b> Clearly the requirements for current
supply differ greatly for magneto and common-battery systems.
There is, however, no great difference between the power plants
required for the automatic and the manual common-battery systems.</p>

<p>In the simplest form of telephone system&mdash;two magneto telephones
on a private line&mdash;the power plant at each station consists of
two elements: one, the magneto generator, which is a translating
device for turning hand power into alternating current for ringing
the bell of the distant station; and the other, a primary battery which
furnishes current to energize the transmitter. In such a system,
therefore, each telephone has its own power plant. The term power
plant, however, as commonly employed in telephone work, refers more
particularly to the organization of devices at the central office for
furnishing the required kinds of current, and it is to power plants
in this sense that this chapter is devoted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Page 228]</a></span></p><p><i>Magneto Systems.</i> If magneto lines be connected to a switchboard,
the current for throwing the drop at the switchboard is furnished
by the subscriber's generator, and the current for energizing
the subscriber's transmitter is furnished by the local battery at his
station; but sources of current must be provided for enabling the
central-office operator to signal or talk to the subscribers. These
are about the only needs for which current must be furnished in an
ordinary magneto central office. If a multiple board is employed,
direct current is also needed for the purpose of the busy test and
also for operating the drop restoring circuits, if the electrical method
of restoring the drops is employed.</p>

<p><i>Common-Battery Systems.</i> In common-battery systems the
requirements are very much more extensive. The subscribers' telephones
have no power plants of their own, but are provided with a
common source of direct current located at the central office for supplying
the talking current, and for operating the central-office signals,
and the operators are provided with one or more common
sources of alternating or pulsating current for ringing the subscribers'
bells. Common-battery equipment requires the use of currents
of different kinds for a greater number of auxiliary purposes than
does magneto equipment. These facts make the power plant in a
common-battery office much more important than in a magneto
office.</p>

<p><b>Operators' Transmitter Supply.</b> In a small magneto exchange,
the transmitter current may be had from primary batteries, a separate
battery being employed for each operator's set. When there are more
than three or four operators, however, it is usual, even in magneto
offices, to obtain the transmitter current from a common storage
battery. A storage battery has the fortunate quality of very low
internal resistance, therefore a number of operators' transmitters may
be actuated by one source without introducing cross-talk. In other
words, a storage battery is a current-furnishing device of good regulation,
the variation of consumption in one circuit leading from it
causing slight variation in the currents of other circuits leading from
it. If this were not so, cross-talk would exist between the telephones
of the operators' positions connected to the same battery. This
regulating quality enables the multiple feeding of telephone circuits
to be carried further than the mere supplying of operators' sets and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Page 229]</a></span>is the quality which makes possible the successful use of a storage
battery as the single source of transmitter current for common-battery
central-office equipment.</p>

<p>In furnishing a plurality of operators' transmitters from a common
battery, the importance of low resistance and inductance in the
portion of the path that is common to all of the circuits must not be
overlooked. Not only is a battery of extremely low resistance required,
but also conductors leading from it that are common to two
or more of the circuits should be of very low resistance and consequently
large in cross-section and as short as possible. In common-battery
offices there is obviously no need of employing a separate
battery for the operators' transmitters, since they may readily
be supplied from the common storage battery which supplies direct
current to the subscribers' lines.</p>

<p><b>Ringing-Current Supply.</b> <i>Magneto Generators.</i> As a central-office
equipment is required to ring many subscribers' bells, only the
small ones find it convenient to ring them by means of hand-operated
magneto generators. Small magneto switchboards are usually
equipped so that each operator is provided with a hand-generator,
but even where such is the case some source of ringing current not
manually operated is desirable. In larger switchboards the hand
generators are entirely dispensed with.</p>

<p>The magneto generator may be driven by a belt from any convenient
constantly moving pulley, and the early telephone exchanges
were often equipped with such generators having better bearings
and more current capacity than those in magneto telephones. These
were adapted to be run constantly from some source of power, delivering
ringing current to the operators' keyboards at from 16 to 20
cycles per second.</p>

<p><i>Pole Changers.</i> Vibrating pole changers were also used in the
early exchanges, but passed out of use, partly because of poor design,
but more because of the absence of good forms of primary batteries
for vibrating them and for furnishing the direct currents to be transformed
into alternating line current for ringing the bells. The pole
changer was redesigned after the beginning of the great spread of
telephony in the United States in 1893. Today it is firmly established
as an element of good telephone practice. Fig. 411 illustrates the
principle upon which one of the well-known pole changers&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Page 230]</a></span>Warner&mdash;operates. In this <i>1</i> is an electromagnet supplied by a
constant-current battery <i>2</i> to keep the vibratory system continually
in motion. This motor magnet and its battery work in a local circuit
and cause vibration in exactly the same manner as the armature
of an ordinary electric door bell is caused to vibrate. The battery
from which the ringing current
is derived is indicated at <i>3</i>, and
the poles of this are connected,
respectively, to the vibrating contacts
<i>4</i> and <i>5</i>. These contacts
are merely the moving members
of a pole changing switch, and a
study of the action will readily
show that when these moving
parts engage the right-hand contacts,
current will flow to the line
supposed to be connected to the
terminals <i>6</i> and <i>7</i> in one direction,
while, when these parts engage
the left-hand contacts, current
will flow to the line in the
reverse direction. The circuit of
the condenser shown is controlled
by the armature of the relay <i>8</i>.</p>

<p>The winding of this relay is put directly in the circuit of the
main battery <i>3</i>, so that whenever current is drawn from this battery
to ring a distant bell, this relay will be operated and will bridge
the condenser across the circuit of the line. The purpose of the condenser
is to make the impulses flowing from the pole changer less
abrupt, and the reason for having its bridged circuit normally broken
is to prevent a waste of current from the battery <i>3</i>, due to the energy
which would otherwise be consumed by the condenser if it were left
permanently across the line.</p>

<br /><b>Fig. 412. Pole Changers for Harmonic Ringing</b><br />
<a href="images/fig412.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Pole changers for ringing bells of harmonic party lines are required
to produce alternating currents of practically constant frequencies.
The ideal arrangement is to cause the direct currents from a storage
battery to be alternated by means of the pole changers, and then
transformed into higher voltages required for ringing purposes, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Page 231]</a></span>transformer also serving to smooth the current wave, making it more
suitable for ringing purposes. In Fig. 412 such an arrangement,
adapted to develop currents for harmonic ringing on party lines,
is shown. The regular common battery of the central office is indicated
at <i>1</i>, <i>2</i> being an auxiliary battery of dry cells, the purpose of
which will be presently referred to. At the right of the battery <i>1</i>
there is shown the calling plug with its associated party-line ringing
keys adapted to impress the several frequencies on the subscribers'
lines. The method by which the current from the main storage battery
passes through the motor magnets of the several vibrators,
and by which the primary currents through the transformers are
made to alternate at the respective frequencies of these vibrators,
will be obvious from the drawing. It is also clear that the secondary
currents developed in these transformers are led to the several ringing
keys so as to be available for connection with the subscribers'
lines at the will of the operator. The condensers are bridged across
the primary windings of the transformers for the purpose of aiding in
smoothing out the current waves. The use of the auxiliary battery
<i>2</i> and the retardation coil <i>3</i> in the main supply lead is for the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Page 232]</a></span>of preventing the pulsating currents drawn from the main
battery <i>1</i> from making the battery "noisy." These two batteries
have like poles connected to the supply lead, and the auxiliary
battery furnishes no current to the system except when the electromotive
force of the impulse flowing from the main battery is choked
down by the impedance coil and the deficiency is then momentarily
supplied for each wave by the auxiliary battery. This is the method
developed by the Dean Electric Company for preventing the pole-changer
system from causing disturbances on lines supplied from
the same main battery.</p>

<p><i>Ringing Dynamos.</i> Alternating and pulsating currents for
ringing purposes are also largely furnished from alternating-current
dynamos similar to those used in commercial power and lighting
work, but specially designed to produce ringing currents of proper
frequency and voltage. These are usually driven by electric motors
deriving their current either from the commercial supply mains or
from the central-office battery. In large exchanges harmonic ringers
are usually operated by alternating-current generators driven by
motors, a separate dynamo being provided to furnish the current of
each frequency. Fig. 413 shows a set of four such generators directly
connected to a common motor. As no source of commercial power
for driving such generators is absolutely uniform, and since the frequency
of the ringing current must remain very close to a constant
predetermined rate, some means must be employed for holding
the generators at a constant speed of revolution, and this is done
by means of a governor shown at the right-hand end of the shaft in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Page 233]</a></span>Fig. 413. The principle of this governor is shown in Fig. 414. A
weighted spring acts, by centrifugal force, to make a contact against
an adjustable screw, when the speed of the shaft rises a predetermined
amount. This spring and its contact are connected to two
collector rings <i>1</i> and <i>2</i> on the motor shaft, and connection is made
with these by the brushes <i>3</i> and <i>4</i>. The closing of the governor
contact serves, therefore, merely to short-circuit the resistance <i>5</i>,
which is normally included in the shunt field of the motor. This
governor is based on the principle that weakening the field increases
the speed. It acts to insert the resistance in series with the field
winding when the speed falls, and this, in turn, results in restoring
the speed to normal.</p>

<p><b>Auxiliary Signaling Currents.</b> Alternating currents, such
as those employed for busy signals to subscribers in automatic systems,
those for causing loud tones in receivers which have been left off
the hook switch, and those for producing loud tones in calling receivers
connected to composite lines, all need to be of much higher frequency
than alternating current for ringing bells. The simplest way of
producing such tones is by means of an interrupter like that of a
vibrating bell; but this is not the most reliable way and it is usual
to produce busy or "busy-back" currents by rotating commutators
to interrupt a steady current at the required rate. As the usual
busy-back signal is a series of recurrent tones about one-half second
long, interspersed with periods of silence, the rapidly commuted
direct current is required to be further commuted at a slow rate, and
this is conveniently done by associating a high-speed commutator with
a low-speed one. Such an arrangement may be seen at the left-hand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Page 234]</a></span>end of the multicyclic alternating machine shown in Fig. 413. This
commuting device is usually associated with the ringing machine
because that is the one thing about a central office that is available for
imparting continuous rotary motion.</p>

<p><b>Primary Sources.</b> Most telephone power plants consume commercial
electric power and deliver special electric current. Usually
some translating device, such as a motor-generator or a mercury-arc
rectifier, is employed to transform the commercial current into the
specialized current required for the immediate uses of the exchange.</p>

<p><i>Charging from Direct-Current Mains.</i> In some cases commercial
direct current is used to charge the storage batteries without
the intervention of the translating devices, resistances being used in
series with the battery to regulate the amount of current. Commercial
direct current usually is available at pressures from 110 volts
and upward, while telephone power plants contain storage batteries
rarely of pressures higher than 50 volts. To charge a 50-volt storage
battery direct from 110-volt mains results in the loss of about half
the energy purchased, this lost energy being set free in the form of
heat generated in the resistance devices. Notwithstanding this, it
is sometimes economical to charge directly from the commercial
direct-current power mains, but only in small offices where the total
amount of current consumed is not large and where the greatest
simplicity in equipment is desirable. It is better, however, in nearly
all cases, to convert the purchased power from the received voltage
to the required voltage by some form of translating device, such
as a rotary converter or a mercury-arc rectifier.</p>

<p><i>Rotary Converters.</i> Broadly speaking, a rotary converter
consists of a motor adapted to the voltage and kind of current received,
mechanically coupled to a generator adapted to produce
current of the required kind and voltage. The harmonic ringing
machine shown in Fig. 413 is an example of this, this particular one
being adapted to receive direct current at ordinary commercial pressure
and to deliver four different alternating currents of suitable
pressures and frequencies. It is to be understood, however, that the
conversion may be from direct current to direct current, from alternating
to direct, or from direct to alternating. Such a device where
the motor is a separate and distinct machine from the generator or
generators is called a <i>motor-generator</i>. It is usual to connect the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Page 235]</a></span>motors and the generators together directly by a coupling having some
flexibility, as shown in Fig. 413, so as to prevent undue friction in
the bearings.</p>

<p>As an alternative to the converting device made up of a motor
coupled to a generator, both motor and generator windings may
be combined on the same core and rotate within the same field.
Such a rotary converter has been called a <i>dynamotor</i>. As a rule the
dynamotor is only suitable for small power-plant work. It has the
following objectionable features: (<i>a</i>) It is difficult to regulate
its output, since the same field serves for both the motor and the dynamo
windings. For this reason its main use is as a ringing machine
where the regulation of the output is not an important factor.
(<i>b</i>) Furthermore, the fact that the motor and dynamo armature
windings are on the same core makes it difficult to guard against
breakdowns of the insulation between the two windings, especially
when the driving current is of high voltage.</p>

<p><i>Charging Dynamos.</i> The dynamo for charging the storage
battery is, of course, a direct-current machine and may be a part of
a motor generator or it may derive its power from some other than
an electric motor, such as a gas or steam engine. It should be able
to develop a voltage slightly above that of the voltage of the storage
battery when at its maximum charge, so as always to be able to deliver
current to the charging battery regardless of the state of charge.
A 30-volt generator, for example, can charge eleven cells in series
economically; a 60-volt generator can charge twenty-five cells in
series economically.</p>

<p>Battery-charging generators are controlled as to their output
by varying a resistance in series with their fields. Such machines
are usually shunt-wound. Sometimes they are compound-wound,
but compounding is less important in telephone generators than in
some other uses. A feature of great importance in the design of
charging generators is smoothness of current. If it were possible
to design generators to produce absolutely even or smooth current,
the storage battery would not be such an essential feature to
common-battery exchanges, because then the generator might deliver
its current directly to the bus bars of the office without any
storage-battery connection and without causing noise on the lines. Such
generators have been built in small units. Even if these smooth current
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Page 236]</a></span>generators were commercially developed to a degree to produce
absolutely no noise on the lines, the storage battery would still be used,
since its action as a reservoir for electrical energy is important. It
not only dispenses with the necessity of running the generators continuously,
but it also affords a safeguard against breakdowns which
is one of its important uses.</p>

<p>The ability to carry the load of a central office directly on the
charging generator without the use of a storage battery is of no
importance except in an emergency which takes the storage battery
wholly out of service. Since the beginning of common-battery
working such emergencies have happened a negligible number of
times. Far more communities have lacked telephone service because
of accidents beyond human control than because of storage-battery
failures.</p>

<p>In power plants serving large offices, the demand upon the
storage battery is great enough to require large plate areas in each
cell. The internal resistance, therefore, is small and considerable
fluctuations may exist in the charging current without their being
heard in the talking circuits. The amount of noise to be heard depends
also on the type of charging generator. Increasing the number
of armature coils and commutator segments increases the smoothness
of the charging current. The shape of the generator pole
pieces is also a factor in securing such smoothness.</p>

<p>If, with a given machine and storage battery, the talking circuits
are disturbed by the charging current, relief may be obtained by
inserting a large impedance in the charging circuit. This impedance
requires to be of low resistance, because whatever heat is developed
in it is lost energy. This means that the best conditions
exist when the resistance is low and the inductance large. These
conditions are satisfied by using in the impedance coil many turns
of large wire and an ample iron core.</p>

<p>Dynamotors are not generally suitable for charging purposes.
Not only is the difficulty in regulating their output a disadvantage,
but the fact that the primary and secondary windings are so closely
associated on the armature core makes them carry into the charging
current, not only the commutator noises of the generator end, but
of the motor end as well.</p>

<p><i>Mercury-Arc Rectifiers.</i> In common-battery offices serving a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Page 237]</a></span>few hundred lines, and where the commercial supply is alternating
current, it is good practice to transform it into direct-battery charging
current by means of a mercury-arc rectifier. It is a device
broadly similar to the mercury-arc lamp produced by Peter Cooper
Hewitt. It contains no
moving parts and operates
at high efficiency without
introducing noises into
the telephone lines. It
requires little care and
has good length of life.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 415. Mercury-Arc Rectifier Circuits</b><br />
<a href="images/fig415.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The circuit of a mercury-arc
rectifier charging
outfit is shown in Fig. 415.
The mercury-arc rectifier
proper consists of a glass
bulb containing vacuum
and a small amount of
mercury. When its terminals
are connected, as indicated&mdash;the
two anodes
across an alternating-current source and the cathode with a circuit that
is to be supplied with direct current&mdash;this device has the peculiarity
of action that current will flow alternately from the two anodes always
to the cathode and never from it. The cathode, therefore, becomes
a source of positive potential and, as such, is used in charging the
storage battery through the series reactance coil and the compensating
reactances, as indicated. The line transformer shown at the
upper portion of Fig. 415, is the one for converting the high-potential
alternating current to the comparatively low-potential current
required for the action of the rectifier. The transformer below this
has a one-to-one ratio, and is called the insulating transformer. Its
purpose is to safeguard the telephone apparatus and circuits against
abnormal potentials from the line, and also to prevent the ground,
which is commonly placed on the neutral wire of transformers on
commercial lighting circuits, from interfering with the ground that
is commonly placed on the positive pole of the central-office battery.</p>

<p><b>Provision Against Breakdown.</b> In order to provide against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Page 238]</a></span>breakdown of service, a well-designed telephone power plant should
have available more than one primary source of power and more
than one charging unit and ringing unit.</p>

<p><i>Duplicate Primary Sources.</i> In large cities where the commercial
power service is highly developed and a breakdown of the
generating station is practically impossible, it is customary to depend
on that service alone. In order to insure against loss of power
due to an accident to portions of the distributing system, it is the common
custom to run two entirely separate power leads into the office,
coming, if possible, from different parts of the system so that a breakdown
on one section will not deprive the telephone exchange of
primary power. In smaller places where the commercial service
is not so reliable, it is usual to provide, in addition to the commercial
electric-power service, an independent source of power in the
form of a gas or steam engine. This may be run as a regular source,
the commercial service being employed as an emergency or <i>vice
versâ</i>, as economy may dictate. In providing a gas engine for driving
charging dynamos, it is important to obtain one having as good
regulation as possible, in order to obtain a charging current of practically
constant voltage.</p>

<p><i>Duplicate Charging Machines.</i> The storage batteries of
telephone exchanges are usually provided of sufficient capacity to
supply the direct-current needs of the office for twenty-four hours
after a full charge has been given them. This in itself is a strong
safeguard against breakdown. In addition to this the charging machines
should be in duplicate, so that a burnt-out armature or other
damage to one of the charging units will not disable the plant.</p>

<p><i>Duplicate Ringing Machines.</i> It is equally important that
the ringing machines, whether of the rotary or vibrating type, be in
duplicate. For large exchanges the ringing machines are usually
dynamos, and it is not unusual to have one of these driven from the
commercial power mains and the other from the storage battery.
With this arrangement complete failure of all sources of primary
power would still leave the exchange operative as long as sufficient
charge remains in the storage battery.</p>

<p><i>Capacity of Power Units.</i> In designing telephone switchboards
it is the common practice to so design the frameworks that
the space for multiple jacks is in excess of that required for the original
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Page 239]</a></span>installation. In a like manner, the power plant is also designed
with a view of being readily increased in capacity to an amount
sufficient to provide current for the ultimate number of subscribers'
lines for which the switchboard is designed. The motor generators,
or whatever means are provided for charging the storage batteries,
are usually installed of sufficient size to care for the ultimate
requirements of the office. The ringing machines are also provided
for the ultimate equipment. However, in the case of the storage
battery, it is common practice to provide the battery tanks of sufficient
size to care for the ultimate capacity, while the plates are installed
for a capacity only slightly in excess of that required for the
original installation. As the equipment of subscribers' lines is increased,
additional plates may, therefore, be added to the cells without
replacing the storage battery as a whole, and without making
extraordinary provisions to prevent the interruption of service. It
is also customary to provide charging and supply leads from the
storage battery of carrying capacity sufficient for the ultimate
requirements of the office.</p>

<p><b>Storage Battery.</b> The storage battery is the power plant
element which has made common-battery systems possible. The
common-battery system is the element which has made the present
wide development of telephony possible.</p>

<p>A storage-battery cell is an electro-chemical device in which
a chemical state is changed by the passage of current through the
cell, this state tending to revert when a current is allowed to flow
in the opposite direction. A storage cell consists of two conductors
in a solution, the nature and the relation of these three elements
being such that when a direct current is made to pass from
one conductor to the other through the solution, the compelled
chemical change is proportional to the product of the current and
its duration. When the two conductors are joined by a path over
which current may flow, a current does flow in the opposite direction
to that which charged the cell.</p>

<p>All storage batteries so far in extensive use in telephone systems
are composed of lead plates in a solution of sulphuric acid in water
called the <i>electrolyte</i>. In charging, the current tends to oxidize
the lead of one plate and de-oxidize the other. In discharging, the
tendency is toward equilibrium.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Page 240]</a></span></p><p>The containers, employed in telephone work, for the plates
and electrolyte are either of glass or wood with a lead lining, the
glass jars being used for the smaller sized plates of small capacity
cells, while the lead-lined wooden tanks are employed with the
larger capacity cells. The potential of a cell is slightly over two
volts and is independent of the shape or size of the plates for a given
type of battery. The storage capacity of a cell is determined by the
size and the number of plates.
Therefore, by increasing the number
of plates and the areas of their
surfaces, the ampere-hour capacity
of the cell is correspondingly increased.
The desired potential of
the battery is obtained by connecting
the proper number of cells in
series. Storage-battery cells used
in telephone work vary from 2
plates having an area of 12 square
inches each, to cells having over
50 plates, each plate having an
area of 240 square inches. The
ampere-hour capacity of these batteries
varies from 6 ampere hours
to 4,000 ampere hours, respectively,
when used at an average 8-hour
discharge rate. In Fig. 416 is illustrated
a storage cell employing a glass container and having fifteen
plates. Each plate is 11 inches high and 10<span class="frac"><sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub></span> inches wide, with an
area, therefore, of 115.5 square inches. Such a cell has a normal
capacity of 560 ampere hours. The type illustrated is one made
by the Electric Storage Battery Company of Philadelphia, Pa.<a name="FNanchor_A_3" id="FNanchor_A_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_3" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<br /><b>Fig. 416. Storage Cell</b><br />
<a href="images/fig416.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>Installation.</i> In installing the glass jars it is customary to
place them in trays partially filled with sand. They are, however,
at times installed on insulators so designed as to prevent moisture
from causing leakage between the cells. The cells using wooden
tanks are placed on glass or porcelain insulators, and the tanks are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Page 241]</a></span>placed with enough clearance between them to prevent the lead
lining of adjacent tanks from being in contact and thereby short-circuiting
the cells. After the positive and the negative plates have
been installed in the tanks, their respective terminals are connected
to bus bars, these bus bars being, for the small types of battery, lead-covered
clamping bolts, while in the larger types reinforced lead
bus bars are employed, to which the plates are securely joined by a
process called lead burning. This process consists in melting a portion
of the bus bar and the terminal lug of the plate by a flame of
very high temperature, thus fusing each individual plate to the proper
bus bar. The plates of adjacent cells are connected to the same bus
bar, thus eliminating the necessity of any other connection between
the cells.</p>

<p><i>Initial Charge.</i> As soon as the plates have been installed in
the tanks and welded to the bus bars, the cell should be filled with
electrolyte having a specific gravity of 1.180 to 1.190 to one-half
inch above the tops of the plates and then the charge should be
immediately started at about the normal rate. In the case of a battery
consisting of cells of large capacity, it is customary to place the electrolyte
in the cells as nearly simultaneously as possible rather than
to completely fill the cells in consecutive order. When the electrolyte
is placed in the cells simultaneously, the charge is started at a
very much reduced rate before the cells are completely filled, the rate
being increased as the cells are filled, the normal rate of charge being
reached when the cells are completely filled. Readings should be
taken hourly of the specific gravity and temperature of the electrolyte,
voltage of the cells, and amperage of charging current. A
record or log should be kept of the specific gravity and voltage of
each of the cells of the battery regularly during the life of the battery
and it is well to commence this record with the initial charge.</p>

<p>The initial charge should be maintained for at least ten hours
after the time when the voltage and specific gravity have reached a
maximum. If for any reason it is impractical to continue the initial
charge uninterrupted, the first period of charging should be at least
from twelve to fifteen hours. However, every effort should be made
to have the initial charge continuous, as an interruption tends to
increase the time necessary for the initial charge, and if the time be
too long between the periods of the initial charge, the efficiency and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Page 242]</a></span>capacity of the cells are liable to be affected. In case of a large
battery, precaution should be taken to insure that the ventilation is
exceptionally good, because if it is not good the temperature is liable
to increase considerably and thereby cause an undue amount
of evaporation from the cells.</p>

<p>The object of the temperature readings taken during the
charge is to enable corrections to be made to the specific gravity
readings as obtained by the hydrometer, in order that the correct
specific gravity may be ascertained. This correction is made by
adding .001 specific gravity for each three degrees in temperature
above 70° Fahrenheit, or subtracting the same amount for each three
degrees below 70° Fahrenheit. At the time the cells begin to gas
they should be gone over carefully to see that they gas evenly, and
also to detect and remedy early in the charging period any defects
which may exist. If there is any doubt in regard to the time at which
the cells reach a maximum voltage and specific gravity, the charge
should be continued sufficiently long before the last ten hours of the
charge are commenced to eliminate any such doubt, as in many cases
poor efficiency and low capacity of a cell later in its life may be
traced to an insufficient initial charge.</p>

<p><i>Operation.</i> After the battery has been put in commission the
periodic charges should be carefully watched, as excessive charging
causes disintegration and decreases the life and capacity of the
battery; while, on the other hand, undercharging will result in sulphating
of the plates and decrease of capacity, and, if the undercharge
be great, will result in a disintegration of the plates. It is,
therefore, essential that the battery be charged regularly and at the
rate specified for the particular battery in question. In order to
minimize the chance of either continuously overcharging or undercharging
the battery, the charges are divided into two classes, namely,
regular charges and overcharges. The regular charges are the
periodic charges for the purpose of restoring the capacity of the
battery after discharge. The overcharges, which should occur
once a week or once in every two weeks, according to the use of the
battery, are for the purpose of insuring that all cells have received
their proper charge, for reducing such sulphating as may have occurred
on cells undercharged, and for keeping the plates, in general,
in a healthy condition. The specific gravity of the electrolyte, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Page 243]</a></span>voltage of the battery, and the amount of gasing observed are all
indications of the amount of charge which the battery has received
and should all be considered when practicable. Either the specific
gravity or voltage may be used as the routine method of determining
the proper charge, but, however, if the proper charge is determined
by the voltage readings, this should be frequently checked by the
specific gravity, and <i>vice versâ</i>.</p>

<p>During the charging and discharging of a battery the level of
the electrolyte in the cells will fall. As the portion of the electrolyte
which is evaporated is mainly water, the electrolyte may be
readily restored to its normal level by adding distilled water or
carefully collected rain water.</p>

<p><i>Pilot Cell.</i> As the specific gravity of all the cells of a battery,
after having once been properly adjusted, will vary the same in all
the cells during use, it has been found satisfactory to use one cell,
commonly termed the pilot cell, for taking the regular specific gravity
readings and only reading the specific gravity of all the cells occasionally
or on the overcharge. This cell must be representative of
all the cells of the battery, and if the battery is so subdivided in use
that several sets of cells are liable to receive different usage, a pilot
cell should be selected for each group.</p>

<p><i>Overcharge.</i> If the battery is charged daily, it should receive
an overcharge once a week, or if charged less frequently, an overcharge
should be given at least once every two weeks. In making
an overcharge this should be done at a constant rate and at a rate
specified for the battery. During the overcharge the voltage of the
battery and the specific gravity of the pilot cell should be taken every
fifteen minutes from the time the gasing begins. The charge should
be continued until five consecutive, specific-gravity readings are
practically the same. The voltage of the battery should not increase
during the last hour of the charge.</p>

<p>As the principal object of the overcharge is to insure that all of
the cells have received the proper charge, it must, therefore, be continued
long enough to not only properly charge the most efficient
cells, but also to properly charge those which are lower in efficiency.
The longer the interval between overcharges, the greater will be the
variation between the cells and, therefore, it is necessary to continue
the overcharge longer when the interval between overcharges is as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Page 244]</a></span>great as two weeks. Before the overcharge is made the cells should
be carefully inspected for short circuits and other abnormal conditions.
These inspections may best be made by submerging an
electric lamp in the cell, if the cell be of wood, or of allowing it to
shine through from the outside, if it be of glass. By this means any
foreign material may be readily detected and removed before serious
damage is caused. In making these inspections it must be borne
in mind that whatever tools or implements are used must be non-metallic
and of some insulating material.</p>

<p><i>Regular Charge.</i> Regular charges are the periodic charges
for restoring the capacity of the battery, and should be made as frequently
as the use of the battery demands. The voltage of the cells
is a good guide for determining when the battery should be recharged.
The voltage of a cell should never be allowed to drop below 1.8
volts, and it is usually considered better practice to recharge when
the battery has reached 1.9 volts. If a battery is to remain idle for
even a short time, it should be left in a completely charged condition.</p>

<p>The regular charges for cells completely equipped with plates
should be continued until the specific gravity of the pilot cell has
risen to five points below the maximum attained on the preceding
overcharge, or, if only partially equipped with plates, until it has risen
to three points below the previous maximum. The voltage per cell
at this time should be from .05 volts to .1 volts below that obtained
on the previous overcharge. At this time all the cells should be
gasing, but not as freely as on an overcharge.</p>

<p><i>Low Cells.</i> An unhealthy condition in a cell usually manifests
itself in one of the following ways: Falling off in specific gravity
or voltage relative to the rest of the cells, lack of gasing when charged,
and color of the plates, either noticeably lighter or darker than those
of other cells of the battery. When any of the above conditions are
found in a cell, the cell should receive immediate attention, as a
delay may mean serious trouble. The cell should be thoroughly
inspected to determine if a short-circuit exists, either caused by some
foreign substance, by an excess of sediment in the bottom of the tank,
or by portions of the plates themselves. If such a condition is found,
the cause should be immediately removed and, if the defect has been
of short duration, the next overcharge will probably restore it to normal
condition. If the defect has existed for some time, it is often
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Page 245]</a></span>necessary to give the cell a separate charge. This may be done by
connecting it directly to the charging generator with temporary
leads and thus bring it back to its normal condition. It is sometimes
found necessary to replace the cell in order to restore the battery
to its normal condition.</p>

<p><i>Sediment.</i> The cells of the battery should be carefully watched
to prevent the sediment which collects in the bottom of the jar or tank
during use from reaching the bottom of the plates, thereby causing
short circuits between them. When the sediment in the cell has
reached within one-half inch of the bottom of the plates, it should
be removed at once. With small cells using glass jars this can most
easily be done directly after an overcharge by carefully drawing off
the electrolyte without disturbing the sediment and then removing
it from the jar. The plates and electrolyte should be replaced in
the jar as soon as convenient to prevent the plates from becoming
dry. If the plates are large and in wooden tanks, the sediment can
most easily be removed by means of a scoop made especially for the
purpose. The preferable time to clean the tanks is just before an
overcharge.</p>

<p><i>Replacing Batteries.</i> There comes a time in the life of nearly
every central-office equipment when the storage battery must be
completely renewed. This is due to the fact that the life of even
the best of storage batteries is not as great as the life of the average
switchboard equipment. It may also be due to the necessity for
greater capacity than can be secured with the existing battery tanks,
usually caused by underestimating the traffic the office will be required
to handle. Again, it is sometimes necessary to make extensive
alterations in an existing battery, perhaps due to the necessity
for changing its location. To change a battery one cell at a time,
keeping the others in commission meanwhile, has often been done,
but it is always expensive and unsatisfactory and is likely to shorten
the life of the battery, due to improper and irregular forming of the
plates during the initial charge. The advent of the electric automobile
industry has brought with it a convenient means for overcoming
this difficulty. Portable storage cells for automobile use
are available in almost every locality and may often be rented at
small cost. A sufficient number of such cells may be temporarily
installed, enough of them being placed in multiple to give the necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Page 246]</a></span>output. By floating a temporary battery so formed across the
charging mains and running the generators continuously, a temporary
source of current supply may be had at small expense for running
the exchange during the period required for alterations. Usually
a time of low traffic is chosen for making the changes, such as
from Saturday evening to Monday morning. Very large central-office
batteries, serving as many as 6,000 lines, have thus been taken
out of service and replaced without interfering with the traffic and
with the use of but a comparatively few portable cells. One precaution
has to be observed in such work, and that is not to subject
the portable cells to too great an overcharge, due to the great excess
of generator over battery capacity. This is easily avoided by
watching the ammeters to see that the input is not in too great excess
of the output, and if necessary, by frequently stopping the machines
to avoid this.</p>

<p><b>Power Switchboard.</b> The clearing-house of the telephone
power plant is the power board. In most cases, it carries switches,
meters, and protective devices.</p>

<p><i>Switches.</i> The switches most essential are those for opening
and closing the motor and the generator circuits of the charging
sets and with these usually are associated the starting rheostats of
the motors and the field rheostats of the generators. The starting
rheostats are adapted to allow resistance to be removed from the
motor armature circuit, allowing the armature to gain speed and increase
its counter-electromotive force without overheating. The
accepted type has means for opening the driving circuit automatically
in case its voltage should fall, thus preventing a temporary interruption
of driving current from damaging the motor armature on its
return to normal voltage.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig417_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 417. Power-Plant Circuits</b><br />
<a href="images/fig417.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>Meters.</i> The meters usually are voltmeters and ammeters,
the former being adapted to read the several voltages of direct currents
in the power plant. An important one to be known is the
voltage of the generator before beginning a battery charge, so that
the generator may not be thrown on the storage battery while generating
a voltage less than that of the battery. If this were done, the
battery would discharge through the generator armature. The voltmeter
enables the voltage of the charging generator to be kept above
that of the battery, as the latter rises during charge. It enables the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Page 248]</a></span>performance of several cells of the battery to be observed. A
convenient way is to connect the terminals of the several cells to jacks
on the power board and to terminate the voltmeter in a plug.</p>

<p>The ammeter, with suitable connections, enables the battery-charge
rate to be kept normal and the battery discharge to be observed.
In order to economize power, it is best to charge the battery
during the hours of heavy load. The generator output then divides,
the switchboard taking what the load requires, the battery receiving
the remainder.</p>

<p>In systems requiring the terminal voltage of the equipment to
be kept constant within close limits, either it is necessary to use two
batteries&mdash;never drawing current from a battery during charge&mdash;or
to provide means of compensating for the rise of voltage while
the battery is under charge. The latter is the more modern method
and is done either by using fewer cells when the voltage per cell is
higher or by inserting counter-electromotive force cells in the discharge
leads, opposing the discharge by more or fewer cells as the
voltage of the battery is higher or lower. In either method, switches
on the power board enable the insertion and removal of the necessary
end cells or counter-electromotive force cells.</p>

<p><i>Protective Devices.</i> The protective devices required on a
power board are principally <i>circuit-breakers</i> and <i>fuses</i>. Circuit-breakers
are adapted to open motor and generator circuits when
their currents are too great, too small, or in the wrong direction.
Fuses are adapted to open circuits when the currents in them are
too great. The best type is that in which the operation of the fuses
sounds or shows an alarm, or both.</p>

<p><b>Power-Plant Circuits.</b> The circuit arrangement of central-office
power plants is subject to wide variation according to conditions.
The type of telephone switchboard equipment, whether
magneto or common-battery, automatic or manual, will, of course,
largely affect the circuit arrangement of the power plant. Fig. 417
shows a typical example of good practice in this respect for use with
a common-battery manual switchboard equipment. Besides showing
the switches for handling the various machines and the charge-and-discharge
leads from the storage battery, this diagram shows
how current from the storage battery is delivered to various parts
of the central-office equipment.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII"></a>CHAPTER XXXIII<br />

<span style="font-size:80%;">HOUSING CENTRAL-OFFICE EQUIPMENT</span></h2>


<p><b>The Central-Office Building.</b> Proper arrangement of the
central-office equipment depends largely upon the design of the
central-office building. The problem involved should not be solved
by the architect alone. The most careful co-operation between the
engineer and the architect is necessary in order that the various parts
of the telephonic equipment may be properly related, and that the
wires connecting them with each other and with the outside lines be
disposed of with due regard to safety, economy, and convenience.
So many factors enter into the design of a central-office building
that it is impossible to lay down more than the most general
rules. The attainment of an ideal is often impossible, because of
the fact that the building is usually in congested districts, and its
very shape and size must be governed by the lot on which it is built,
and by the immediate surroundings. Frequently, also, the building
must be used for other purposes than those of a telephone office,
so that the several purposes must be considered in its design. Again,
old buildings, designed for other purposes, must sometimes be altered
to meet the requirements of a telephone office, and this is perhaps
the most difficult problem of all.</p>

<p>The exterior of the building is a matter that may be largely
decided by the architect and owner after the general character of
the building has been determined. One important feature, however,
and one that has been overlooked in many cases that we know of,
is to so arrange the building that switchboard sections and other
bulky portions of the apparatus, which are necessarily assembled at
the factory rather than on the site, may be brought into the building
without tearing down the walls.</p>

<p><i>Fire Hazard.</i> The apparatus to be housed in a central-office
building often represents a cost running into the hundreds of thousands
of dollars; but whether of large or small first cost, it is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Page 250]</a></span>evident that its destruction might incur a very much greater loss
than that represented by its replacement value. In guarding
the central-office equipment against destruction by fire or other
causes, the telephone company is concerned to a very much greater
extent than the mere cost of the physical property; since it is guarding
the thing which makes it possible to do business. While the
cost of the central office and its contents may be small in comparison
with the total investment in outside plant and other portions
of the equipment, it is yet true that these larger portions of the investment
become useless with the loss of the central office.</p>

<p>There is another consideration, and that is the moral obligation
of the operating company to the public. A complete breakdown
of telephone service for any considerable period of time in a
large city is in the nature of a public calamity.</p>

<p>For these reasons the safeguarding of the central office against
damage by fire and water should be in all cases a feature of fundamental
importance, and should influence not only the character of
the building itself, but in many cases the choice of its location.</p>

<p><i>Size of Building.</i> It goes without saying that the building
must be large enough to accommodate the switchboards and other
apparatus that is required to be installed. The requirement does
not end here, however. Telephone exchange systems have, with
few exceptions, grown very much faster than was expected when
they were originally installed. Many buildings have had to be
abandoned because outgrown. In planning the building, therefore,
the engineer should always have in mind its ultimate requirements.
It is not always necessary that the building shall be made large enough
at the outset to take care of the ultimate requirements, but where
this is not done, the way should be left clear for adding to it when
necessity demands.</p>

<p><i>Strength of Building.</i> The major portion of telephone central-office
apparatus, whether automatic or manual, is not of such weight
as to demand excessive strength in the floors and walls of buildings.
Exceptions to this may be found in the storage battery, in the power
machinery, especially where subject to vibration, and in certain
cases in the cable runs. After the ultimate size of the equipment has
been determined, the engineer and the architect should confer on
this point, particularly with reference to the heavier portions of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Page 251]</a></span>apparatus, to make sure that adequate strength is provided. The
approximate weights of all parts of central-office equipments may
readily be ascertained from the manufacturers.</p>

<p><i>Provision for Employes.</i> In manual offices particularly it has
been found to be not only humane, but economical to provide adequate
quarters for the employes, both in the operating rooms and
places where they actually perform their work, and in the places
where they may assemble for recreation and rest. The work of
the telephone operator, particularly in large cities, is of such a nature
as often to demand frequent periods of rest. This is true not
only on account of the nervous strain on the operator, but also on
account of the necessity, brought about by the demands of economy,
for varying the number of operators in accordance with the traffic
load. These features accentuate the demand for proper rooms
where recreation, rest, and nourishment may be had.</p>

<p><i>Provision for Cable Runways.</i> In very small offices no special
structural provision need be made in the design of the building itself
for the entrance of the outside cables, and for the disposal of the
cables and wires leading between various portions of the apparatus.
For large offices, however, this must necessarily enter as an important
feature in the structure of the building itself. It is important that
the cables be arranged systematically and in such a way that they
will be protected against injury and at the same time be accessible
either for repairs or replacement, or for the addition of new cables to
provide for growth. Disorderly arrangement of the wires or cables
results in disorder indeed, with increased maintenance cost, uneconomical
use of space, inaccessibility, liability to injury, and general
unsightliness.</p>

<p>The carrying of cables from the basement to the upper floors
or between floors elsewhere must be provided for in a way that will
not be wasteful of space, and arrangements must be made for supporting
the cables in their vertical runs. In the aggregate their
weight may be great, and furthermore each individual cable must
be so supported that its sheath will not be subject to undue strain.
Another factor which must be considered in vertical cable runs is
the guarding against such runs forming natural flues through which
flames or heated gases would pass, in the event of even an unimportant
fire at their lower ends.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Page 252]</a></span></p><p><b>Arrangement of Apparatus in Small Manual Offices.</b> Where
a common-battery multiple switchboard equipment is used, at least
three principal rooms should be provided&mdash;one for the multiple
switchboard proper; one for the terminal and power apparatus,
including the distributing frames, racks, and power machinery; and
the third for the storage battery. These should adjoin each other for
purposes of convenience and of economy in wiring.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig418_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 418. Typical Small Office Floor Plan</b><br />
<a href="images/fig418.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>Floor Plans for Small Manual Offices.</i> As was pointed out,
there are several plans of disposing of the main and intermediate
distributing frames and the line and cut-off relay racks. The one
most practiced is to mount the relay rack alongside the main and
intermediate distributing frame in the terminal room. A typical
floor plan of such an arrangement for a small office, employing as a
maximum five sections of multiple switchboards, is shown in Fig.
418. This is an ideal arrangement well adapted for a rectangular
floor space and on that account may often be put into effect. It
should be noted that the switchboard grows from left to right, and
that alternative arrangements are shown for disposing of those sections
beyond the second. The cable turning section through which
the multiple and answering jacks are led to the terminal frames is
placed as close as possible to the terminal frames. This results in a
considerable saving in cable. An interesting feature of this floor
plan is the arrangement of unitary sections of main and intermediate
frames and relay racks, representing recent practice of the Western
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Page 253]</a></span>Electric Company. The iron work of the three racks is built
in sections and these are structurally connected across so that the
first section of the main frame, the intermediate frame, and the relay
rack form one unit, the structural iron work which ties them together
forming the runway for the cables between them. But two
of these units, including two sections of each frame, are shown installed,
the provision for growth being indicated by dotted lines.</p>

<p>The battery room in this case provides for the disposal of the
battery cells in two tiers. This room is merely partitioned off from
the distributing or terminal room. Where
this is done the partition walls should be
plastered on both sides so as to prevent,
as far as possible, the entrance of any battery
fumes into the apparatus rooms.</p>

<p>The wire chief's desk, as will be noted,
is located in such a position as to give easy
access from it not only to the distributing
frames and relay rack, but to the power
apparatus as well.</p>

<p><i>Combined Main and Intermediate
Frames.</i> For use in small exchanges, the
Western Electric Company has recently
put on the market a combined main and
intermediate distributing frame. This is
constructed about the same as an ordinary
main frame, the protectors being on one
side and the line and intermediate frame
terminals on the other. The lower half of
the terminals on each vertical bay is devoted
to the outside line terminals and the upper half is devoted to intermediate
frame terminals. This arrangement is indicated in the
elevation in Fig. 419. With the use of this combined main and
intermediate frame, the floor plan of Fig. 418 may be modified,
as shown in Fig. 420.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<a href="images/fig421.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>In Fig. 421 is given an excellent idea of terminal-room apparatus
carried out in accordance with the more usual plan of employing
separate main and intermediate distributing frames. At the extreme
right of this figure the protector side of the main frame is shown.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Page 254]</a></span>It will be understood that the line cables terminate on the horizontal
terminal strips on the other side of this frame and are connected
through the horizontal and vertical runways of the frame to the
protector terminals. The intermediate frame is shown in the central
portion of the figure, the side toward the left containing the answering-jack
terminals, and the side toward the right the multiple
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Page 255]</a></span>jack terminals, these latter being arranged horizontally. This
horizontal and vertical arrangement of the terminals on the main
and intermediate distributing frames has been the distinguishing
feature between the Bell and Independent practice, the Bell Companies
adhering to the horizontal and vertical arrangement, while
the Independent Companies have employed the vertical arrangement
on both sides. We are informed that in the future the new smaller
installations of the Bell Companies will be made largely with the
vertical arrangement on both sides. At the left of Fig. 421 is shown
the relay rack in two sections of two bays each. This illustration
also gives a good idea of the common practice in disposing of the
cables between the frames in iron runways just below the ceiling of
the terminal room.</p>

<p><i>Types of Line Circuits.</i> The design of the terminal-room
floor plan will depend largely on the arrangement of apparatus in
the subscribers' line circuits with respect to the distributing frames
and relay racks. The Bell practice in this respect has already been
referred to and is illustrated in Fig. 348. In this the line and cut-off
relays are permanently associated with the answering jacks and
lamps, resulting in the answering-jack equipment being subject to
change with respect to the multiple and the line through the jumpers
of the intermediate frame. The practice of the Kellogg Company,
on the other hand, has been illustrated in Fig. 353, and in this
the line and cut-off relays are permanently associated with the multiple
and with the line, only the answering jacks and lamps being
subject to change through the jumper wires on the intermediate
frame. This latter arrangement has led to a very desirable parallel
arrangement of the two distributing frames and the relay rack.
These are made of equal length so as to correspond bay for bay,
and are placed side by side with only enough space between them
for the passage of workmen&mdash;the relay rack lying between the main
and intermediate frames. In this scheme all the multiple and answering-jack
cables run from the intermediate distributing frame,
and the cabling between the intermediate frame and the relay rack
and between the relay rack and the main frame is run straight across
from one rack to the other. This results in a great saving of cable
within the terminal room, over that arrangement wherein the cabling
from one frame to another is necessarily led along the length of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Page 256]</a></span>frame to its end and then passes through a single runway to the end
of the other frame.</p>

<p><b>Large Manual Offices.</b> For purposes of illustrating the practice
in housing the apparatus in very large offices equipped with manual
switchboards, we have chosen the Chelsea office of the New York
Telephone Company as an excellent example of modern practice.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 422. Floor Plan, Operating Room, Chelsea Office, New York City</b><br />
<a href="images/fig422.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The ground plan of the building is <b>U</b>-shaped, in order to provide
the necessary light over the rather large floor areas. The plan of
the operating floor&mdash;the sixth floor of the building&mdash;is shown in Fig.
422. As will be seen, this constitutes a single operating room, the
<i>A</i>-board being located in the right wing and the <i>B</i>-board in the left.
The point from which both boards grow is near the center of the
front of the building, the boards coming together at this point in a
common cable turning section. The disposal of the various desks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Page 257]</a></span>for the manager, chief operator, and monitors is indicated. Those
switchboard sections which are shown in full lines are the ones at
present installed, the provision for growth being indicated in dotted
lines.</p>

<br /><b>Fig. 423. Terminal Room and Operators' Quarters, Chelsea Office, New York City</b><br />
<a href="images/fig423.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The fifth floor is devoted to the terminal room and operators'
quarters, the terminal room occupying the left-hand wing and the
major portion of the front of the building, and the operators' quarters
the right-hand wing. The line and the trunk cables come up
from the basement of the building at the extreme left, being supported
directly on the outside wall of the building. Arriving at the
fifth floor, they turn horizontally and are led under a false flooring
provided with trap doors, to the protector side of the main frame.
The disposal of the cables between the various frames will be more
readily understood by reference to the following photographs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Page 258]</a></span></p><p>A general view of a portion of the <i>A</i>-board of the Chelsea office
is shown in Fig. 424, this view being taken from a point in the left-hand
wing looking toward the front. In Fig. 425 is shown a closer
view of a smaller portion of the board. Fig. 426 gives an excellent
idea of the rear of this switchboard and of the disposal of the cables
and wires. The main mass of cables at the top are those of the
multiple. Immediately below these may be seen the outgoing
trunk cables. The forms of the answering-jack cables lie below
these and are not so readily seen, but the cables leading from these
forms are led down to the runway at the bottom of the sections, and
thence along the length of the board to the intermediate distributing
frame on the floor below. The layer of cables, supported on the iron
rack immediately above the answering-jack cable runway, shown
at the extreme bottom of the view, are those containing the wires
leading from the repeating coils to the cord circuits.</p>

<p>An interesting feature of this board is the provisions for protection
against injury by fire and water. On top of the boards throughout
their entire length there is laid a heavy tarpaulin curtain with
straps terminating in handles hanging down from its edges. These
may be seen in Fig. 426 and also in Fig. 425. The idea of this is
that if the board is exposed to a water hazard, as in the case of fire,
the board may be completely covered, front and rear, with this tarpaulin
curtain, by merely pulling the straps. The entire force&mdash;both
operators and repairmen&mdash;is drilled to assure the carrying out
of this plan.</p>

<p>The rear of the boards is adapted to be enclosed by wooden
curtains, similar to those employed in roll-top desks. These are
all raised in the rear view of Fig. 426, the housing for the rolled-up
curtain being shown at the extreme top of the sections. In order
to guard the multiple cables and the multiple jacks against fire
which might originate in the cord-circuit wiring, a heavy asbestos
partition is placed immediately above the cord racks and is clearly
shown in Fig. 426.</p>

<p>A view of the terminal and power room is shown in Fig. 427.
In the upper left-hand corner the cables may be seen in their passage
downward from the cable turning section between the <i>A</i>- and <i>B</i>-boards.
The large group of cables shown at the extreme left is the
<i>A</i>-board multiple. This passes down and then along the horizontal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Page 263]</a></span>shelves of the intermediate frame, which is the frame in the extreme
left of this view. The <i>B</i>-board multiple comes down through another
opening in the floor, and as is shown, after passing under the
<i>A</i>-board multiple joins it in the same vertical run from which it passes
to the intermediate frame. The cord-circuit cables lead down through
the same opening as that occupied by the <i>A</i>-board multiple and pass
off to the right-hand one of the racks shown, which contains the
repeating coils. The cables leading from the opening in the ceiling
to the right-hand side of the intermediate distributing frame are the
answering-jack cables, and from the terminals on this side of this
frame other cables pass in smaller groups to the relay terminals on
the relay racks which lie between the intermediate frame and the
coil rack.</p>

<p>The power board is shown at the extreme right. The fuse
panel at the left of the power board contains in its lower portion fuses
for the battery supply leads to the operator's position and to private-branch
exchanges, and in its upper portion lamps and fuses for
the ringing generator circuits for the various operators' positions
and also for private-branch exchanges.</p>

<p>At the lower left-hand portion of this view is shown the battery
cabinet. It is the practice of the New York Telephone Company
not to employ separate battery rooms, but to locate its storage batteries
directly in the terminal room and to enclose them, as shown,
in a wooden cabinet with glass panels, which is ventilated by means
of a lead pipe extending to a flue in the wall.</p>

<p>One unit of charging machines, consisting of motor and generator,
is shown in the immediate foreground. A duplicate of this
unit is employed but is not shown in this view. The various ringing
and message register machines are shown beyond the charging machines.
Three of these smaller machines are for supplying ringing
current and the remainder are for supplying 30-volt direct current
for operating the message registers. One of the machines of
each set is wound to run from the main storage battery in case of a
failure of the general lighting service from which the current for
operating is normally drawn.</p>

<p><b>Automatic Offices.</b> There is no great difference in the amount
of floor space required in central offices employing automatic and
manual equipment. Whatever difference there is, is likely to be in
favor of the automatic. The fact that no such rigid requirement
exists in the arrangement of automatic apparatus, as that which
makes it necessary to place the sections of a multiple board all in
one row, makes it possible to utilize the available space more economically
with automatic than with manual equipment.</p>

in fact, so far as the distributing-frame equipment is concerned, it
is considered desirable to have it located in the same room as the

<p>The battery room in an automatic exchange should be entirely

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV"></a>CHAPTER XXXIV<br />

<span style="font-size:80%;">PRIVATE BRANCH EXCHANGES</span></h2>


<p><b>Definitions.</b> A telephone exchange devoted to the purely local
uses of a private establishment such as a store, factory, or business
office, is a private exchange. If, in addition to being used for such
local communication, it serves also for communication with the
subscribers of a city exchange, it becomes in effect a branch of the
city exchange and, therefore, a private branch exchange. The term
"P. B. X." has become a part of the telephone man's vocabulary
as an abbreviation for private branch exchange.</p>

<p>Private exchanges for purely local use require no separate treatment
as any of the types of switching equipments for interconnecting
the lines for communication, that have been or that will be described
herein, may be used. The problem becomes a special one, however,
when communication must also be had with the subscribers of a
public exchange, since then trunking is involved in which the conditions
differ materially from those encountered in trunking between
the several offices in a multi-office exchange.</p>

<p>For such communication one or more trunk lines are led from
the private branch office usually to the nearest central office of the
public exchange and such trunks are called private branch-exchange
trunks. They are the paths for communication between the private
exchange and the public exchange. For establishing the connections
either between the local lines themselves or between the local lines and
the trunks, and for performing other duties that will be referred to,
one or more private branch-exchange operators are employed at the
switchboard of the private establishment.</p>

<p>The private branch exchange may operate in conjunction with
a manual or an automatic public exchange, but whether manual
or automatic, the private exchange is usually manually operated,
although it is quite possible to make a private branch exchange that
is wholly automatic and will, therefore, involve no operator at all.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Page 272]</a></span></p><p><b>Functions of the Private Branch-Exchange Operator.</b> It is
possible, as just stated, entirely to dispense with the private branch-exchange
operator so far as the mere connection and disconnection
of the lines is concerned. But the real function of the private
branch-exchange operator is a broader one than this and it is for
this reason that even in connection with automatic public exchanges,
operators are desirable at the private branches. The private branch-exchange
operator is, as it were, the doorkeeper of the telephone
entrance to the private establishment. She is the person first met
by the public in entering this telephone door. There is the same
reason, therefore, why she should be intelligent, courteous, and
obliging as that the ordinary doorkeeper should possess these
characteristics.</p>

<p>As to incoming traffic to a private branch exchange, an intelligent
operator may do much toward directing the calls to the proper
department or person, even though the person calling may have little
idea as to whom he desires to reach. This saves the time of the person
who makes the call as well as that of the people at the private
branch stations, since it prevents their being unnecessarily called.</p>

<p>The functions of the private branch-exchange operator are no
less important with respect to outgoing calls. It is the duty of the
operator to obtain connections through the city exchange for the
private branch subscriber, who merely asks for a certain connection
and hangs up his receiver to await her call when she shall have
obtained it. This saving of time of busy people by having the branch-exchange
operator make their calls for them has one attending disadvantage,
which is that the person in the city exchange who is called
does not, when he answers his telephone, find the real party with
whom he is to converse, but has to wait until that party responds to
the private branch operator's call. This is akin to asking a person
to call at one's office and then being out when he gets there. This
drawback is greatly accentuated where both the parties that are to
be involved in the connection are people high in authority in certain
establishments at private branch exchanges. Some business houses
have made the rule that the private branch operator shall not connect
with their lines until she has actually heard the voice of the
proper party at the other end. When two subscribers in two different
private branch exchanges where this rule is enforced, attempt to get
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Page 273]</a></span>into communication with each other, the possibilities of trouble are
obvious.</p>

<p>All that may be said on this matter is that the person who calls
another by telephone should extend that person the same courtesies
that he would had he called him in person to his office; and that a
person who is called by telephone by another should meet him with
the same consideration as if he had received a personal call at his
office or home. The arbitrary ruling made by some corporations
and persons, which results always in the "other fellow's" doing the
waiting, is not ethically correct nor is it good policy.</p>

<p><b>Private Branch Switchboards.</b> Private branch switchboards may
be of common-battery or magneto types regardless of whether
they work in conjunction with main office equipments having common-battery
or magneto equipments. Usually a magneto private
branch exchange works in conjunction with a magneto main office,
but this is not always true. There are cases where the private
branch equipment of modern common-battery type works in conjunction
with main office equipment of the magneto type; and in some
of these cases the private branch exchange has a much larger number
of subscribers than the main office. This is likely to be true in large
summer resort hotels located in small and otherwise unimportant
rural districts. In one such case within our knowledge the private
branch exchange has a larger number of stations than the total census
population of the town, resulting in an apparent telephone
development considerably greater than one hundred per cent.</p>

<p><i>Magneto Type.</i> Where both the private branch and the main
office equipments are of the magneto type, the private branch requirements
are met by a simple magneto switchboard of the requisite
size, and the trunking conditions are met by ring-down trunks extending
to the main office. In this case the supervision is that of
the ordinary clearing-out drop type, the operators working together
as best they may.</p>

<p><i>Common-Battery Type.</i> The cases where the private branch
board is of common-battery type and the main office of magneto
type are comparatively so few that they need not be treated here.
Where they do occur they demand special treatment because the
main portion of the traffic over the trunk lines to the city or town
central office is likely to be toll traffic through that office over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Page 274]</a></span>long-distance lines. The principal reason why the equipment of
the town offices under such conditions is magneto rather than common
battery is that the traffic conditions are those of short season and
heavy toll, and common-battery switching equipment at the main
office has no especial advantages for toll work.</p>

<br /><b>Fig. 438. Desk Type, Private Branch Board</b><br />
<a href="images/fig438.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>For small private branch exchanges the desk type of switch
board, shown in Fig. 438, is largely used. The operator frequently
has other work to do and the desk is, therefore, a convenience. In
larger private exchanges, such as those requiring more than one
operator, some form of upright cabinet is employed, and if, as sometimes
occurs, the branch exchange is of such size as to demand
a multiple board, then the general form of the board does not differ
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Page 275]</a></span>materially from the standard types of multiple board employed in
regular central office work. The most common private branch-exchange
condition is that of a common-battery branch working into
a common-battery main office. In such the main point to be considered
is that of supervision of trunk-line connections.</p>

<p><i>Cord Type.</i> For the larger sizes of branch exchange switchboards,
the switching apparatus is practically the same as that of ordinary
manual switchboards wherein the connections are made between
the various lines by means of pairs of cords and plugs. The
private branch-exchange trunk lines usually terminate on the private
branch board in jacks but in some cases plug-ended trunks are used.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 439. Key Type, Private Branch Board</b><br />
<a href="images/fig439.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The line signals may consist in mechanical visual signals or in
lamps, the choice between these depending largely on the source
of battery supply at the branch exchange, a matter which will be
considered later. The trunk-line signals at the private branch board
are usually ordinary drops which are thrown when the main-exchange
operator rings on the line as she would on an ordinary subscriber's
line. Frequently, however, lamp signals are used for this purpose,
being operated by locking relays energized when the main-office
operator rings or, in some cases, operated at the time when the
main-office operator plugs into the trunk-line jack.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 440. Circuits, Key-Type Board</b><br />
<a href="images/fig440.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>Key Type.</i> For small private branch-exchange switchboards,
a type employing no cords and plugs has come into great favor during
recent years. Instead of connecting the lines by jacks and plugs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Page 276]</a></span>they are connected by means of keys closely resembling ordinary
ringing and listening keys. Such a switchboard is shown in Fig.
439, this having a capacity of three trunks, seven local lines, and the
equivalent of five cord circuits. The drops associated with the three
trunks may be seen in the upper left-hand side of the face of the
switchboard. Immediately below these in three vertical rows are the
keys which are used in connecting the trunks with the "cord circuits"
or connecting bus wires. At the right of the drop associated
with the trunks are seven visual signals, these being the calling signals
of the local lines. The seven vertical rows of keys, immediately
to the right of the three trunk-line rows, are the line keys. The
throwing of any one of these keys and of a trunk-line key in the same
horizontal row in the same direction will connect a line with a trunk
through the corresponding bus wires, leaving one of the supervisory
visual signals, shown at the extreme top of the board, connected
with the circuit. The keys in a single row at the right are those
by means of which the operator may bridge her talking set across any
of the "cord circuits." The circuits of this particular board are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Page 277]</a></span>shown in Fig. 440. This is equipped for common-battery working,
the battery feed wires being shown at the left.</p>

<p><b>Supervision of Private Branch Connections.</b> At the main office
where common-battery equipment is used, the private branch trunks
terminate before the <i>A</i>-operators exactly in the same way as ordinary
subscribers' lines, <i>i. e.</i>, each in an answering jack and lamp at one
position and in a multiple jack on each section. It goes without saying,
therefore, that the handling of a private branch call, either incoming
or outgoing, should be done by the <i>A</i>-operator in the same manner
as a call on an ordinary subscriber's line, and that the supervision
of the connection should impose no special duties on the <i>A</i>-operator.</p>

<p>There has been much discussion, and no final agreement, as to
the proper method of controlling the supervisory lamp at the main
office of a cord that is, at the time, connected to a private branch
trunk. Three general methods have been practiced:</p>

<p>The first method is to have the private branch subscriber directly
control the supervisory lamp at the main office without producing
any effect upon the private branch supervisory signal; this latter
signal being displayed only after the connection has been taken down
at the main office and in response to the withdrawal of the main office
plug from the private branch jack. This is good practice so far as
the main-office discipline is concerned but it results in a considerable
disadvantage to both the city and private branch subscribers in that
it is impossible for the private branch subscriber, when connected
to the other, to re-signal the private branch operator without the
connection being first taken down.</p>

<p>The second method is to have the private branch subscriber
control both the supervisory signal at the private branch board and
at the main board. This has the disadvantage of bringing both
operators in on the circuit when the private branch subscriber signals.</p>

<p>The third method, and one that seems best, is to place the supervisory
lamp of the private branch board alone under the control of the
private branch subscriber, so that he may attract the attention of the
private branch operator without disturbing the supervisory signal
at the main office. The supervisory signal at the main office in
this case is displayed only when the private branch operator takes
down the connection. This practice results in a method of operation
at the main office that involves no special action on the part of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Page 278]</a></span><i>A</i>-operator. She takes down the connection only when the main-office
subscriber has hung up his telephone and the private branch
subscriber has disconnected from the trunk.</p>

<p>Whatever method is employed, private branch disconnection is
usually slow, and for this reason many operating companies instruct
the <i>A</i>-operators to disconnect on the lighting of the supervisory lamp
of the city subscriber.</p>

<p><b>With Automatic Offices.</b> Private branch exchanges most
used in connection with automatic offices employ manual switchboards,
with the cord circuits of which is associated a signal transmitting
device by which the operator instead of the subscriber may
manipulate the automatic apparatus of the public exchange by
impulses sent over the private branch-exchange trunk lines. The
subscriber's equipment at the private branch stations may be either
automatic or manual. Frequently the same private branch exchange
will contain both kinds. With the manual sub-station equipment
the operation is exactly the same as in a private branch of a manual
exchange, except that the private branch operator by means of her
dial makes the central-office connection instead of telling the main-office
operator to do so for her. With automatic sub-station equipment
at the private branch the subscribers, by removing their
receivers from their hooks, call the attention of the private branch
operator, who may receive their orders and make the desired central-office
connection for them, or who may plug their lines through to the
central office and allow the subscribers to make the connection themselves
with their own dials.</p>

<p>In automatic equipment of the common-battery type, some
change always takes place in the calling line at the time the called
subscriber answers. In the three-wire system during the time of
calling, both wires are of the same polarity with respect to earth.
At the time of the answering of the called subscriber, the two wires
assume different polarities, one being positive to the other. Such a
change is sufficient for the actuation of devices local to the private
exchange switchboard and may be interpreted through the calling
supervisory signal in such a way as to allow it to glow during calling
and not to glow after the called subscriber has answered. In the
two-wire automatic system a similar change can be arranged for,
with similar advantageous results.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Page 279]</a></span></p><p><i>Secrecy.</i> In private exchanges operating in connection with
automatic central offices, the secret feature of individual lines may
or may not be carried into the private exchange equipment. Some
patrons of automatic exchanges set a high value on the absence of
any operator in a connection and transact business over such lines
which they would not transact at all over manual lines or would not
transact in the same way over manual lines. To some such patrons,
the presence of a private exchange operator, even though employed
and supervised by themselves, seems to be a disadvantage. To
meet such a feeling, it is not difficult to arrange the circuits of a
private exchange switchboard so that the operator may listen in upon
a cord circuit at any time and overhear what is being said upon it
<i>so long as two subscribers are not in communication on that cord circuit</i>.
That is, she may answer a call and may speak to the calling person at
any time she wishes until the called person answers. When he does
answer and conversation can take place, some device operates to
disconnect her listening circuit from the cord circuit, not to be connected
again until at least one of the subscribers has hung up his
receiver. With private exchange apparatus so arranged, the secrecy
of the system is complete.</p>

<p><b>Battery Supply.</b> There are three available methods of supplying
direct current for talking and signaling purposes to private
branch exchanges, each of which represents good practice under
certain conditions. First, by means of pairs of wires extended from
the central-office battery; second, by means of a local storage battery
at the private branch exchange charged over wires from the central
office; and third, by means of a local storage battery at the private
exchange charged from a local source.</p>

<p>The choice of these three methods depends always on the local
conditions and it is a desirable feature, to be employed by large
operating companies, to have all private branch-exchange switchboards
provided with simple convertible features contained within
the switchboard for adapting it to any one of these methods of supplying
current.</p>

<p>If a direct-current power circuit is available at the private
branch exchange, it may be used for charging the local storage battery
by inserting mere resistance devices in the charging leads. If
the local power circuit carries alternating current, a converting device
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Page 280]</a></span>of some sort must be used and for this purpose, if the exchange
is large enough to warrant it, a mercury rectifier is an economical and
simple device.</p>

<p>The supply of current to private branch exchanges over wires
leading to the central-office battery has the disadvantage of requiring
one or several pairs of wires in the cables carrying the trunk wires.
No special wires are run, regular pairs in the paper insulated line or
trunk cables being admirably suited for the purpose. Sufficient conductivity
may be provided by placing several such pairs in multiple.</p>

<p>If the amount of current required by the private exchange
warrants it, pairs of charging wires from the central office may be
fewer if a battery is charged over them than if they are used direct
to the bus bars of the private exchange switchboard. If they are
used in the latter way, and this is simpler for reasons of maintenance,
some means must be provided to prevent the considerable resistance
of the supply wires from introducing cross-talk into the circuit of
the private exchange. This is accomplished by bridging a considerable
capacity across the supply pairs at the private exchange&mdash;ten
to twelve microfarads usually suffice. This point has already
been referred to and illustrated in connection with Fig. 141.</p>

<p>The number of pairs of wires, or, in other words, the amount of
copper in the battery lead between the central office and the private
branch-exchange switchboard needs to be properly determined not
only to eliminate cross-talk when the proper condensers are used with
them, but to furnish the proper difference of potential at the private
exchange bus bars, so that the line and supervisory signals will receive
the proper current. It is a convenience in installing and maintaining
private exchange switchboards of this kind to prepare tables showing
the number of pairs of No. 19 gauge and No. 22 gauge wires
required for a private exchange at a given distance from its central
office and of a probable amount of traffic. The traffic may be expressed
in the maximum number of pairs of cords which will be in
use at one time. With this fact and the distance, the number of pairs
of wires required may be determined.</p>

<p><b>Ringing Current.</b> The ringing current may be provided in
two ways: over pairs of wires from the city-office ringing machines
or by means of a local hand generator, or both. A key should enable
either of these sources of ringing current to be chosen at will.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Page 281]</a></span></p><p><b>Marking of Apparatus.</b> All apparatus should be marked with
permanent and clear labels. That private exchange switchboard is
best at which an almost uninformed operator could sit and operate
it at once. It is not difficult to lay out a scheme of labels which will
enable such a board to be operated without any detailed instructions
being given.</p>

<p><b>Desirable Features.</b> The board should contain means of connecting
certain of the local private exchange lines to the central-office
trunks when the board is unattended. Also, it is desirable
that it should contain means whereby any local private exchange
line may be connected to the trunk so that its station will act as an
ordinary subscriber's station. Whether the trunks of the private
exchange lead to a manual or an automatic equipment, it often is
desired to connect a local line through in that way, either so that the
calling person may make his calls without the knowledge of the private
exchange operator, because he wishes to make a large number
of calls in succession, or because for some other reason he prefers to
transact his business directly with or through the exchange than to
entrust it to his operator.</p>

<p><b>Definition.</b> The term "intercommunicating" has been given
to a specialized type of telephone system wherein the line belonging
to each station is extended to each of the other stations, resulting in
all lines extending to all stations. Each station is provided with
apparatus by means of which the telephone user there may connect
his own telephone with the line of the station with which he wishes
to communicate, enabling him to signal and talk with the person at
that station.</p>

<p><b>Limitations.</b> The idea is simple. Each person does his own
switching directly, and no operator is required. It is easy to see,
however, that the system has limitations. The amount of line wire
necessary in order to run each line to each station is relatively great,
and becomes prohibitive except in exchanges involving a very small
number of subscribers, none of which is remote from the others.
Again, the amount of switching apparatus required becomes prohibitive
for any but a small number of stations. As a result, twenty-five
or thirty stations are considered the usual practical limit for
intercommunicating systems.</p>

<p><b>Types.</b> An intercommunicating system may be either magneto
or common-battery, according to whether it uses magneto or
common-battery telephones. The former is the simpler; the latter
is the more generally used.</p>

<p><b>Simple Magneto System.</b> The schematic circuit arrangement
of an excellent form of magneto intercommunicating system is given
in Fig. 441. In this, five metallic circuit lines are led to as many
stations, an ordinary two-contact open jack being tapped off of each
line at each station. A magneto bell of the bridging type is permanently
bridged across each line at the station to which that line
belongs. The telephone at each station is an ordinary bridging
magneto set except that its bell is, in each case, connected to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Page 283]</a></span>line as just stated. Each telephone is connected through a flexible
cord to a two-contact plug adapted to fit into any of the jacks at the
same station.</p>

<p>The operation is almost obvious. If a person at Station <i>A</i> desires
to call Station <i>E</i>, he inserts his plug into the jack of line <i>E</i> at his
station and turns his generator crank. The bell of Station <i>E</i> rings
regardless of where the plug of that station may be. The person
at Station <i>E</i> responds by inserting his own plug in the jack
of line <i>E</i>, after which the two parties are enabled to converse over
a metallic circuit. It makes no difference whether the persons,
after talking, leave these plugs in the jacks or take them out, since
the position of the plug does not alter the relation of the bell with
the line.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>This system has the advantage of great simplicity and of being
about as "fool proof" as possible. It is, however, not quite as convenient
to use as the later common-battery systems which require
no turning of a generator crank.</p>

<p><b>Common-Battery Systems.</b> In the more popular common-battery
systems two general plans of operation are in vogue, one
employing a plug and jacks at each station for switching the "home"
instrument into circuit with any line, and the other employing merely
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Page 284]</a></span>push buttons for doing the same thing. These may be referred to as
the plug type and the push-button type, respectively.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<a href="images/fig442.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>Kellogg Plug Type.</i> The circuits of a plug type of intercommunicating
system, as manufactured by the Kellogg Company, are
shown in Fig. 442. While only three stations are shown, the method
of connecting more will be obvious.</p>

<p>This system requires as many
pairs of wires running to all stations
as there are stations, and in
addition, two common wires for
ringing purposes. The talking battery
feed is through retardation
coils to each line. When all the
hooks are down, each call bell is
connected between the lower common
wire and the tip side of the
talking circuit individual to the
corresponding station. The ringing
buttons at each station are connected
between the tip of the plug
at that station and the upper common
wire. As a result, when a person
at one station desires to call another,
it is only necessary for him to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Page 285]</a></span>insert his plug in the jack of the desired station and press his ringing
button; the circuit being traced from one pole of the ringing battery
through the upper common ringing wire, ringing key of the station
making the call, tip of plug, tip conductor of called station's line, bell
of called station, and back to the ringing battery through the lower
common ringing wire.</p>

<p><i>Kellogg Push-Button Type.</i> Fig. 443 shows a Kellogg wall-type
intercommunicating set employing the push-button method of
selecting, and Fig. 444 shows the internal arrangement of this set.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><i>Western Electric System.</i> The method of operation of the push-button
key employed in the intercommunicating system of the Western
Electric Company is well shown in Fig. 445. When the button
is depressed all the way down, as shown in the center cut of Fig. 445,
which represents the ringing position of the key, contact is made with
the line wires of the station called, and ringing current is placed on
the line. When the pressure is released, the button assumes an intermediate
position, as shown in the right-hand cut, which represents
the talking position of the key and in which the ringing contacts <i>1</i> and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Page 286]</a></span><i>2</i> are open, but contact with the line for talking purposes is maintained.
The key is automatically held in this intermediate position by locking
plate <i>3</i> until this plate is actuated by the operation of another button
which releases the key so that it assumes its normal position as
shown in the left-hand cut. When a button is depressed to call a
station, it first connects the called station's line to the calling station
through the two pairs of contacts <i>4</i> and <i>5</i> and then connects the ringing
battery to that line by causing the spring <i>1</i> to engage the contact
<i>2</i>. The ringing current then passes through the bell at the called
station, through the back contacts of the switch hook at that station,
over one side of the line, and through the "way-down" contact <i>1</i> of
the button at the calling station, thence over the other side of the
battery line back to the ringing battery, operating the bell at the
called station.</p>

<p>The circuits of the Western Electric system are similar to those
of Fig. 442, but adapted, of course, to the push-button arrangement
of switches. Two batteries are employed, one for ringing and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[Page 287]</a></span>other for talking, talking current being fed to the lines through retardation
coils to prevent interference or cross-talk from other stations
which might be connected together at the same time.</p>

<p><i>Monarch System.</i> As the making of connections in an intercommunicating
system is entirely in the hands of the user, it is desirable
that the operation be simple and that carelessness on the
part of the user result in as few evil effects as possible. For instance,
the leaving of the receiver off its hook will, in many systems, result
in such a drain on the battery as to greatly shorten its life.</p>

<p>The system of the Monarch Company has certain distinctive
features in this respect. It is of the push-button type and as in the
system just discussed, one pressure of the finger on one button clears
the station of previous connections, rings the station called, and
establishes a talking connection
between the caller's telephone
and the line desired. In addition
to this, the system is designed
to eliminate battery waste by so
arranging the circuits that the
battery current does not flow
through either called or calling
instrument until a complete connection
is made&mdash;the calling button
down at one station, the home button down at the called station,
and both receivers off the hook. It does not hurt the batteries,
therefore, if one neglects to hang up his receiver.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<a href="images/fig447.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Three views of the wall set of this system are shown in Fig.
446, which illustrates how both the door and the containing box
are separately hinged for easy access to the apparatus and connecting
rack. As in the Western Electric and Kellogg push-button systems,
each push-button key has three positions, as shown in Fig. 447. The
first button shows all the springs open, the normal position of the
key. The second button is in the half-way or talking position with
all the springs, except the ringing spring, in contact. The third
button shows the springs all in contact, the condition which exists
when ringing a station.</p>

<p>The mechanical construction of the key is shown in Fig. 448.
Each button has a separate frame upon which the springs are mounted.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Page 288]</a></span>Any one of the frames with its group of contact springs may be removed
without interfering with either the electrical or the mechanical
operation of the others. This is a convenient feature, making
possible the installation of as few stations as are needed at first, and
the subsequent addition of buttons as other stations are added.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig448_t.jpg" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 448. Push-Button Keys</b><br />
<a href="images/fig448.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The restoring feature is a horizontal metal carriage, in construction
very much like a ladder&mdash;one round pressing against each key
frame, due to the tension on the carriage exerted by a single flat
spring. The plunger of each button is equipped with a shoulder,
which normally is above the round of the ladder. When the button
is operated, this shoulder presses against a round of the carriage
forcing it over far enough so that the shoulder can slip by. The
upper surface of the shoulder is flat, and on passing below the pin,
allows the carriage to slip back into its normal position and the pin
rests on the top of the shoulder holding the plunger down. This
position places the talking springs in contact. The ringing springs
are open until the plunger is pressed all the way down, then the ringing
contact is made. When the pressure is released, the plunger
comes back to the half-way or talking position, leaving the ringing
contacts open again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Page 289]</a></span></p><p>When another button is pressed, the same operation takes place
and, by virtue of the carriage being temporarily displaced, the original
key is left free to spring back to its normal position.</p>

<p>Each station is provided with a button for each other station and
a "home" button. The salient feature of the system is that before
a connection may be established, the button at the calling station
corresponding to the station called and also the home button of the
station called must be depressed, if it is not already down. The
home key at any station, when depressed, transposes the sides of the
line with respect to the talking apparatus. The home key also has
a spring which changes the normal connection of the line at that
station from the negative to the positive side of the talking battery.
Unless, therefore, a connection between two stations is made through
the calling key at one station and the home key at the other, no current
can flow even though both receivers are off their hooks, because
in that case no connection will exist with the positive side of the battery.
This relation is shown in Fig. 449, which gives a simplified
circuit arrangement for two connected stations.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig449_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 449. Monarch Intercommunicating System</b><br />
<a href="images/fig449.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Referring to Fig. 449, when the station called depresses the home
button the talking circuit is then completed after the hook switch is
raised. This is because the talking battery is controlled by the
home key. Conductors from both the negative and the positive
sides of the battery enter this key. In the normal position of the
springs, the negative side of the battery is in contact with the master
spring in the home key and through these springs the negative battery
is applied to all the calling keys, and from there on to the hook
switch. When, however, the home button is operated, the spring
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Page 290]</a></span>which carries the negative battery to the home key is opened, and
the spring which carries the positive battery is closed. This puts
the positive battery on at the hook switch instead of the negative
battery, as in its normal condition.</p>

<p>In this system it is seen that a separate pair of line wires is used
for each station, and in addition to these, two common pairs are run
to all stations, one for ringing and one for talking battery connections.</p>

<p><b>For Private Branch Exchanges.</b> So far the intercommunicating
system has been discussed only with respect to its use in small isolated
plants. It has a field of usefulness in connection with city exchange
work, as it may be made to serve admirably as a private
branch exchange. Where this is done, one or more trunk lines leading
to an office of the city exchange are run through the intercommunicating
system exactly as a local line in that system, being
tapped to a jack or push button at every station. A person at any
one of the stations may originate a call to the main office by inserting
his plug in the trunk jack, or pushing his trunk push button. Also
any station, within hearing or sight of the trunk-line signal from
the main office, may answer a main-office call in the same way. In
order that the convenience of a private branch exchange may be
fully realized, however, it is customary to provide an attendant's
station at which is placed the drop or bell on which the incoming
trunk signal is received. The duty of this attendant during business
hours is to answer trunk calls from the main office and finding
out what party is desired, call up the proper station on the intercommunicating
system. The party at that station may then connect
himself with the trunk.</p>

<p>The practice of the Dean Company, for instance, is as follows
in regard to trunking between intercommunicating systems and
main offices with common-battery equipment. The attendant's
station telephone cabinet contains, besides the push-button keys
for local and trunk connections, a drop signal and release key, together
with relays in each trunk circuit. The latter are used to hold
the trunks until the desired party responds.</p>

<p>The main-exchange trunk lines, besides terminating at the attendant's
station, are wired through the complete intercommunicating
system so that any intercommunicating telephone can be connected
direct to the central office by depressing the trunk key, which is provided
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Page 291]</a></span>with a button of distinctive color. The pressing of the trunk
key allows the telephone to take its current from the main-office
storage battery and to operate
the main-office line and supervisory
signals direct, without
making it necessary to call on
the attendant to set up the
connection.</p>

<br /><b>Fig. 451. Typical Arrangement of Intercommunicating System</b><br />
<a href="images/fig451.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Incoming calls from the
common-battery main office to
the intercommunicating system
are all handled by the attendant.
The main-office operator signals the intercommunicating system
by ringing, the same as for a regular subscriber's line. This
will operate a drop in the attendant's station cabinet, and through
an armature contact, give a signal on a low-pitched buzzer. This
alarm buzzer operates only when the main exchange is ringing and,
therefore, does not require that the drop shutter be restored immediately.
An extra key may be provided for an extension night-alarm
bell, for use where the attendant also does work in a room separate
from that containing the attendant's station telephone equipment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Page 292]</a></span></p><p>The attendant operator answers the main-line signal by pressing
the proper trunk button, as designated by the operated drop
on the attendant's cabinet. The answering of the trunk connects
a locking relay across the circuit so that the attendant may call
the desired party on the intercommunicating system without having
to hold the trunk manually. The party desired is then notified which
trunk to use and the attendant operator hangs up her receiver, no
further attention being necessary on her part.</p>

<p>The trunk-holding relay is automatically released when the
desired party (with the telephone receiver off the hook) depresses the
proper trunk button, thus clearing the trunk line of all bridged
apparatus and making the talking circuit the same as in the regular
type of private branch-exchange switchboard.</p>

<p>The most convenient way of installing the wires of an intercommunicating
system is to run a cable containing the proper number
of pairs to provide for the ultimate number of stations to all the stations,
tapping off from the conductors in the cable to the jacks or
push buttons at each station. These tap connections are best made
by means of junction boxes which contain terminals for all the conductors.</p>

<p>Such a junction box, with the through cable and the tap cable
in place, is illustrated in Fig. 450. A schematic lay-out of the various
parts of a Dean intercommunicating system, provided with an
attendant's station and with trunks to a city office, is given in Fig. 451.</p>

<span style="font-size:80%;">LONG-DISTANCE SWITCHING</span></h2>


<p><b>Definitions.</b> Telephone messages between communities are
called long-distance messages. They are also called toll messages.
Almost all long-distance traffic is handled by message-rate (measured-service)
methods of charge. All measured-service messages are
toll messages, whether they are completed within a given community
or between communities. The term "long-distance," therefore, is
more descriptive than the term "toll." The subject of local and
long-distance measured service is treated exhaustively in a chapter of
its own.</p>

<p>Some telephone-exchange operating companies call their own
inter-city business "toll," and use the term "long-distance" for business
carried between exchanges for them by another company. The
distinction seems to be unwarranted.</p>

<p><b>Use of Repeating Coil.</b> Most long-distance lines are magneto
circuits. If they are switched to grounded circuits, repeating
coils need to be inserted. Toll switching equipments contain means
of inserting repeating coils in the connecting cords when required.
Their use reduces the volume of transmitted speech, but often is
essential even in connecting metallic circuit lines, as a quiet local
metallic circuit may have a ground upon it which will cause excessive
noises when a quiet long-distance line is connected to it.</p>

<p><b>Switching through Local Board.</b> In the simplest form of
long-distance switching, the lines terminate in switchboards with
local lines and may be connected with each other and with the local
lines through the regular cord circuits, if the equipment be of the
magneto type. The waystations on such a line are equipped with
magneto generators. These waystations may signal each other by
bell ringing; the central office may call any waystation by ringing the
proper signal and may supervise in a way all traffic on such lines
by noting the calls for other stations than the supervising exchange.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[Page 294]</a></span></p><p><b>Operators' Orders.</b> <i>By Call Circuits.</i> Where the long-distance
traffic between two communities is large, economy requires
that the sending of signals by ringing over the line, waiting for an
answer, and then reciting the details of the call, be improved upon.
If the traffic is large and the distance between communities small,
call circuits are established in the same way as between the switchboards
in several manual central offices of an exchange. The long-distance
operator handling the originating call passes the necessary
details to the distant operator by telephone over the call circuit.
Such circuits also are known as order circuits. They are accessible
to originating operators at keys and are connected directly and permanently
to the telephone sets of receiving operators. One call
circuit can handle the orders for a large number of actual conversation
circuits. The operator at the receiving end designates the
conversation circuit which shall be used, the originating operator
following that instruction.</p>

<p><i>By Telegraph.</i> Where traffic and distance are large, conversation
lines cost more than in the case last assumed. It then is of
greater importance to use all the possible talking circuits for actual
conversations in order that the revenue may be as high as possible.
A phantom circuit good enough for call circuit purposes would be
good enough for actual commercial messages, therefore, it is
customary to furnish such originating and receiving operators with
Morse telegraph sets. The lines are obtained by applying composite
apparatus to the conversation circuits. Two Morse circuits can
be had from each long-distance line without impairing any quality
of that line except the ability to ring over it. As one Morse circuit
can carry information enough between two operators to enable them
to keep many telephone circuits busy, they do not need to ring upon
the composited lines, so that nothing is lost while revenue is gained.</p>

<p><b>Two-Number Calls.</b> In cases where the traffic between communities
is large, where the rate is small, and where the conversations
are short and more on the general order of local calls, it is usual
to handle the switches exactly as local calls are trunked between
central offices of the same exchange. That is, the subscriber's
operator who answers the call trunks it, by the assistance of a call
circuit and an incoming trunk operator. The subscriber's operator
records only the numbers of the calling and called subscribers.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Page 295]</a></span>No long-distance operators at all assist in these connections. They
are known as "two-number calls." The calling subscriber remains
at his telephone until the conversation is finished.</p>

<p><b>Particular-Party-Calls.</b> In cases where the traffic is smaller,
and where the rate is large, it is customary to handle the calls through
long-distance operators. The ticket records the particular party
wished, and the calls are named "particular party" calls. In such
connections the calling patron is allowed to hang up his receiver,
after his call is recorded, and is called again when his correspondent
is found and is ready to talk. This makes <i>all calls for conversations</i>
outgoing ones. Only recording operators receive calls <i>from</i> patrons.
Line operators make calls <i>to</i> patrons.</p>

<p><b>Trunking.</b> Long-distance lines entering a city usually terminate
in one office only, no matter how many offices the local exchange
may have. It is possible to terminate these long-distance lines on
a position of the multiple switchboard for local lines. For a variety
of reasons this is not practiced except in special cases. The usual
method is to terminate them in a special long-distance board and
to provide trunk lines from this board to the one or more local switchboards
of the exchange. In common-battery systems these toll
trunks are so arranged that the called local subscriber receives transmitter
current from the office nearest to him, yet is able to show the
long-distance operator the position of his switch hook and is able to
be called by the long-distance operator without the intervention of
the switching operator in the local office, even though two repeating
coils may be in the trunk circuit.</p>

<p><i>Through Ringing.</i> There is a distinct traffic advantage in
having the ringing of the subscriber under the control of the long-distance
operator. The latter may call for the subscriber by stating
her wish over the call circuit associated with the long-distance trunk.
The connection having been made by the switching operator, the
long-distance operator may withhold ringing the subscriber's bell
until all is in readiness for the conversation.</p>

<p><i>High-Voltage Toll Trunks.</i> In some systems, the long-distance
trunks are further specialized by being enabled to furnish
transmitter current to subscribers at a higher voltage than is used in
local conversations. With a given construction of transmitters
there is a critical maximum current which can be carried by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Page 296]</a></span>granular carbon of the instrument without excessive heating, consequent
noises, and permanent damage. The shortest lines and the
longest lines of an exchange district being served by a source of
current common to all, the standard potential of this source must be
such as to give the longest lines current enough without giving the
shortest lines too much. The very longest local lines, however, do
not receive current enough from the standard potential to give maximum
efficiency when talking over long distances, though they get
enough for local conversations. By providing a battery with a voltage
twice that used for local conversations and connecting it into the
current supply element of the toll trunk through non-inductive resistances,
not too much current may be given to the shortest lines
and considerably more than normal current to the longest lines.</p>

<p><b>Ticket Passing.</b> When only one operator is necessary in a town,
her duty being to switch both local and long-distance lines, she may
write her own tickets and execute them entire. In larger communities
with larger long-distance traffic, the duties need to be specialized.
The subscribers' wants as to long-distance connections are
given by themselves to recording long-distance operators, who write
them on tickets and pass these to operators who get the parties
together. The problem of ticket-passing becomes important and
many mechanical carriers have been tried, culminating in the system
which utilizes vacuum tubes. This is in some ways similar to vacuum
or compressed-air tube systems for carrying cash in retail stores.
The ticket is carried, however, without any enclosing case and the
tubes are flat instead of round, <i>i. e.</i>, they are rectangular in section.
By suitable means a vacuum is maintained in a large common
tube having a tap to a box-like valve at each line operator's position.
A ticket tube connects this valve with a distributing table at or near
which the tickets are written. The tickets are of uniform size and
are so made as to enable a flap to be bent up easily along one edge.
The distributing operator has merely to insert the ticket, bent edge
foremost, in the open end of the tube, whereupon the air pressure
behind it will drive it through to its destination, near by or far away.
The tickets travel thirty feet a second. The tube may be bent into
almost any required form. The ticket, on arriving at a line operator's
position, slides between two springs, breaking a shunt around
a relay and allowing the latter to light the lamp.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Page 297]</a></span></p><p><b>Waystations.</b> Waystations on long-distance lines may be
equipped in several ways. Most of them have magneto sets and
can ring each other. Some are equipped with common-battery sets
and get all current for signaling and transmission from a terminal
central office. In the latter case, there is the advantage that the
ringers are in series with condensers, assisting greatly in tests for
fault locations. Such tests are hindered by the presence of ringer
bridges across the line, as in magneto practice. Condensers can be
inserted in series with ringers of magneto sets if the testing advantage
is valued highly enough. A disadvantage of the use of common-battery
sets in waystations on long-distance lines is the lessened
transmission volume of the stations farthest from the current source.</p>

<p><i>Center Checking.</i> An operating advantage of common-battery
sets on long-distance lines is that all calls are forced to be answered
by the terminal station. Waystations can not call each other, as
they have no calling means. With magneto sets, waystation agents
sometimes call each other direct and neglect to record the call and
to remit its price. When they can not call each other direct, the
revenues of the company increase.</p>

<p>A traffic method which requires all calls from waystations to
be made to a central switching office is called a center-checking
system. It is so called because all checking for stations so switched
is done at the central point instead of each waystation keeping its
own records of calls sent and received. In such practice it is usual
to bill each station once a month for the messages it sent. Where
center checking is not practiced, the agent makes a report and sends
a remittance. Center checking comes about naturally for waystations
having no ringing equipment.</p>

<p>Center checking originated long before the invention of common-battery
systems. It requires merely that no waystation shall have
a generator which can ring a bell. The method most widely used
is to equip the waystations with magneto generators which produce
direct currents only; such a generator cannot operate a polarized
ringer. It is not usual to produce the direct current by actually
rectifying the alternating current, but merely by omitting half the impulses,
sending to the line only alternate half-cycles of the current
generated. Any drop or relay adapted to respond to regular ringing
current will respond to this modified form of generator.</p>

<span style="font-size:80%;">TELEPHONE TRAFFIC</span></h2>


<p>The term "traffic," with reference to telephone service, has
come to mean the gross transaction of communication between
telephone users. This traffic may be expressed in whatever terms
are found convenient for the particular phase considered.</p>

<p><b>Unit of Traffic.</b> With reference to payment for local telephone
service, the conversation is the unit of traffic. In the daily operations
of telephone systems there are fewer conversations than there are
connections and fewer connections than there are calls, because
lines are found busy and all calls to subscribers are not answered.</p>

<p>For these reasons, in traffic inquiries which have to do with
the amount of business which subscribers attempt to transact, the
total traffic in a given time usually is considered as so many calls
originated by the subscribers in the community. From this condition
arises the term "originating calls."</p>

<p>For the reason that the purpose of the switching equipment
in a central office is to make connections, the abilities of operators
and of equipments frequently are measured in terms of connections
per hour or per other unit of time.</p>

<p>For the reason that in charging for service all unavailing calls
are omitted, the conversation is the unit of traffic.</p>

<p><b>Traffic Variations.</b> Telephone-exchange traffic is subject to
such general variations as are noted in the way a compass needle
points north, the migrations of birds, the blowing of the trade winds,
and other natural phenomena. There are variations in traffic
which occur each day, others which change with the seasons, and
still others which are related to holidays and other special commercial
and social events. For instance, the day before Thanksgiving
Day, in many regions, is the busiest telephone traffic day in the year.</p>

<p>The daily variations in telephone traffic are closely related to
commercial activities and certain general features of this daily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[Page 299]</a></span>variation are common to all telephone systems everywhere. Fig.
452 is a typical graphic record of the traffic of a telephone exchange
and represents what happens in almost every town or city. The
total calls in this figure are not given as absolute units but would
vary to adapt the figure to a particular case. The figure shows
principally that the traffic in the night is light; that it rises to its
maximum height somewhere between 10 o'clock <span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and noon; that
though it is never as high again during that day, the afternoon peak
is over 80 per cent as great; and that two minor peaks appear about
the dinner hour and after evening entertainments.</p>

<p><i>Busy-Hour Ratio.</i> If the story told by Fig. 452 were to be turned
into a table of calls per hour, the busiest hour of the day would be
found to correspond to the highest portion of the figure, and in that
busiest hour of the day, if a number of selected days were to be compared,
would be found a very constant traffic. The number of calls
made, or the number of connections completed, in that particular
hour, day by day, would be found to be much the same. The ratio
of the number of units in that hour to the number of units in that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Page 300]</a></span>entire day would be found to be practically the same ratio day by
day. This ratio of busy hour to total day would be found to be
much more nearly constant than the gross number of calls per hour
or per day.</p>

<p>In a large, busy city, about one-eighth of the total daily calls are
in some one hour; in a smaller, less active city, probably one-tenth
are so congested. This is reasonable when one remembers that in the
larger city the active business of the day begins later and ends earlier.</p>

<p><b>Importance of Traffic Study.</b> A knowledge of the amount of
traffic in an exchange, and its distribution as to time and as to the
divisions of the exchange, is important for a number of reasons.
Traffic knowledge is essential in order that the equipment may be
designed and placed in the proper way and the total load distributed
properly on that apparatus and its operators.</p>

<p>For example, in an office equipped with a manual multiple
switchboard, the length of the switchboard is governed entirely by
the number of operators who must work before it. It is mechanically
possible to make a switchboard for ten thousand lines only 15 feet
long, seating seven operators. The entire multiple of ten thousand
lines could appear three times in such a switchboard. The seven
operators could not handle the traffic we know would be originated
by ten thousand lines, with any present system of charging for service.
Even a rough knowledge of the probable traffic would enable
us to approximate the number of operators needed and to equip each
position, not only with access to the ten thousand lines to be called,
but also with just enough keyboard equipment, serving as tools,
and just enough answering jacks, serving as means of bringing the
traffic to her. It is foreknowledge of traffic which enables a switchboard
to fit the task it is to perform.</p>

<p><b>Rates of Calling.</b> The rates of calling of different kinds of lines
vary. The lines of business stations originate more calls than do
the lines of residences. Some kinds of business originate more calls
than others. Some kinds of business have a higher rate of calling
in one season than in others. Flat-rate lines originate more calls
than do message-rate lines. When a line changes from a flat rate to a
message rate, the number of originating calls per day decreases. An
operator's position, handling message-rate lines only, can serve more
lines than if all of them were at flat rates. The number of message-rate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Page 301]</a></span>or coin-prepayment lines which an operator's position can care
for depends not only on the traffic but on the method of charging for
service, whether by tickets or meters and upon the kind of meters; or
it depends on the method of collecting the coins. In some regions,
the rate of calling, on the introduction of a complete measured-service
plan, has been reduced to one-fourth of what it was on the flat-rate plan.</p>

<p>In manual switchboards of early types, wherein the position of
the subscriber's answering jack was fixed by his telephone number,
the inequality of traffic became a serious problem. Most of the subscribers
who first installed telephones when the exchange was small,
retained their telephones and numbers; as their use of the telephone
grew with their business, it was customary to find the positions
answering the lower numbers much more busy than the positions
answering the higher numbers, the latter belonging to later and usually
less active business places.</p>

<p><i>Functions of Intermediate Distributing Frame.</i> The intermediate
distributing board was invented to meet these conditions of
unequal traffic upon lines and of variations in traffic with changes of
seasons and of charges. The intermediate distributing board enables
a line to retain its number and its position in the multiple, but
to keep its answering jack and lamp signal in any desired position.
If a flat-rate subscriber changes to a message rate, his line may be
moved to a message-rate position and be answered, in company
with others like it, by an operator serving many more lines than she
could serve if all of them were flat rate.</p>

<p><b>Methods of Traffic Study.</b> The best way to learn traffic
facts for the purposes of designing and operating equipment is to
conduct systematic series of observations in all exchanges; to record
them in company with all related facts; and to compare them from
time to time, recording the results of the comparisons. Then when
it is required to solve a new problem, the traffic data will enable the
probable future conditions to be known with as great exactness as is
possible in studies with relation to transportation or any other human
activity.</p>

</table></div>

<p>There are three general ways of observing traffic. A record of
originating calls is known as a "peg count," because the counting
formerly was done by moving a peg from place to place in a series of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Page 302]</a></span>holes. The simplest exact way is to provide each operator with a
small mechanical counter, the key of which she can depress once for
each call to be counted. A second way is to determine a ratio which
exists, for the particular time and place, between the number of calls
in a given period and the average number of cord circuits in use.
Knowing this ratio, the cord circuits can be counted, the ratio applied,
and the probable total known. The third method, which is
applicable to offices having service meters on all lines, is to associate
one master meter per position or group of lines with all the meters
of that position or group, so that each time any service meter of that
position is operated, the master meter will count one unit. This
method applies to either manual or automatic equipments.</p>

<p><b>Representative Traffic Data.</b> For purposes of comparison, the
following are representative facts as to certain traffic conditions.</p>

<p><i>Calling Rates.</i> The number of calls originated per day by different
kinds of lines with different methods of charge are shown in
Table XIII.</p>

<p><i>Operators' Loads.</i> The abilities of subscribers' operators to
switch these calls depend on the type of equipment used, on the
kind of management exercised, and on the individual skill of operators.
With manual multiple equipment of the common-battery type,
and good management, the numbers of originating calls per busy
hour given in Table XIV can be handled by an average operator. The
number of calls per operator per busy hour depends upon the amount
of trunking to other offices which that operator is required to do. In
a small city, for example, where all the lines are handled by one
switchboard, there is no local switching problem except to complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Page 303]</a></span>the connection in the multiple before each position. In a large city,
where wire economy and mechanical considerations compel the lines
to be handled by a number of offices with manual equipment, some
portion of the total originating load of each office must be trunked to
others. Table XIV shows that an increase of 90 per cent in the
amount of out-trunking has decreased the operator's ability to less
than 70 per cent of the possible maximum.</p>

</table></div>

<p><i>Trunking Factor.</i> In providing the system of trunks interconnecting
the offices, whether the equipment be manual or automatic,
it is essential to know not only how much traffic originates
in each office, but how much of it will be trunked to each other office
and how many trunks will be required. An interesting phase of
telephone traffic studies is that it is possible to determine in advance
the amount of traffic which can be completed directly in the multiple
of that office and how much must be trunked elsewhere. Theoretical
considerations would indicate that if the local multiple contains
one-eighth of the total lines of the city, one-eighth of the calls originating
in that office could be completed locally and seven-eighths
would be trunked out. In almost all cases, however, it is found that
more than the theoretical percentage of originating calls are for the
neighborhood of that office and can be completed in the multiple.
This results in the determination of a factor by which the theoretical
out-trunking can be multiplied to determine the probable real out-trunking.
In most cases, the ratio of actual to theoretical out-trunking
is 75 per cent, or approximately that. In special cases, it
may be far from 75 per cent.</p>

<p><i>Trunk Efficiency.</i> The capacities of trunks vary with their
methods of operation and with the number of trunks in a group.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[Page 304]</a></span>For example, in the manual system where trunk operators in distant
offices are instructed over call circuits and make disconnections in
response to lamp signals, such an incoming trunk operator can complete
from 250 to 500 connections per busy hour. The actual ability
depends upon the number of distant offices served by that operator
and upon the amount of work she has to perform on each call.</p>

<p>The number of messages which can be handled by one trunk in
the busy hour will depend upon the number of trunks in the group
and upon the system employed. It appears that the ability of trunks
in this regard is higher in the automatic system than in the manual
system. For the latter, Table XV gives representative facts.</p>

<p class="center"><b>TABLE XV</b></p>
<p class="center"><b>Messages per Trunk in Manual System</b></p>

<div class="center">
<table border="0" cellpadding="4" cellspacing="0" summary="" class="bl">

</table></div>

<p>Some of the reasons for the higher efficiencies of trunks in the
automatic system are not well defined, but unquestionably exist.
They have to do partly with the prompter answering observable in
automatic systems. The operation of calling being simple, a called
subscriber seems to fear that unless he answers promptly the calling
party will disconnect and perhaps may call a competitor. The introduction
of machine-ringing on automatic lines, where existing in
competition with manual ringing on manual lines, seems to encourage
subscribers to answer even more promptly. The length of conversation
in automatic systems seems to be shorter than in manual systems.
Still more important, disconnection in automatic systems is instantaneous
during all hours, whereas in manual systems it is less prompt
in the busiest and least busy hours than in the hours of intermediate
congestion. The practical results of trunk efficiencies in automatic
systems are given in Table XVI.</p>

</table></div>

<p><i>Toll Traffic.</i> Toll or long-distance traffic follows the general
laws of local or exchange traffic. Conversations are of greater
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[Page 305]</a></span>average length in long-distance traffic. The long-distance line is
held longer for an average conversation than is a local-exchange line.
The local trunks which connect long-distance lines with exchange
lines for conversation are held longer than are the actual long-distance
trunks between cities. Knowing the probable traffic to be brought
to the long-distance switching center by the long-distance trunks
from exchange centers, the number of trunks required may be determined
by knowing the capacity of each trunk. These trunk capacities
vary with the method of handling the traffic and they vary as
do local trunks with the number of trunks in a group. Table XVII
illustrates this variation of capacity with sizes of groups.</p>

</table></div>

<p><b>Quality of Service.</b> The quality of telephone service rendered
by a particular equipment managed in a particular way depends on
a great variety of elements. The handling of the traffic presented
by patrons is a true manufacturing problem. The quality of the service
rendered requires continuous testing in order that the management
may know whether the service is reaching the standard; whether
the standard is high enough; whether the cost of producing it can be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[Page 306]</a></span>reduced without lowering the quality; and whether the patrons are
getting from it as much value as they might.</p>

<p>In manual systems, the quality of telephone service depends
upon a number of elements. The following are some principal ones:</p>

<blockquote><ol><li>Prompt answering.</li>

<li>Prompt disconnection.</li>

<li>Freedom from errors in connecting with the called line.</li>

<li>Promptness in connecting with the called line.</li>

<li>Courtesy and the use of form.</li>

<li>Freedom from failure by busy lines and failure to answer.</li>

<li>Clear enunciation.</li>

<li>Team work.</li>
</ol></blockquote>

<p><i>Answering Time.</i> There is an interrelation between these
elements. Team work assists both answering and prompt disconnection.
The quality of telephone service can not be measured
alone in terms of prompt answering. Formerly telephone service
was boasted of as being "three-second service" if most of the originating
calls were answered in three seconds. Often such prompt
answering reacts to prevent prompt disconnecting. Patient, systematic
work is required to learn the real quality of the service.</p>

<p>As to answering, the clearest, truest statement concerning
manual service is found by making test calls to each position, dividing
them into groups of various numbers of whole seconds each, and
comparing the percentage of these groups to the whole number of
telephones to that position. For example, assume each of the calls
to a given position to have been answered in ten seconds or less, in
which</p>

<blockquote><p style="text-indent:0;">100 per cent are answered in ten seconds or less;<br />
80 per cent in eight seconds or less;<br />
60 per cent in six seconds or less.</p></blockquote>

<p>It is probable that a reasonably uniform manual service will show
only a small percentage answered in three seconds or under. Such
percentages may be drawn in the form of curves, so that at a glance
one may learn efficiency in terms of prompt answering.</p>

<p><i>Disconnecting Time.</i> Prompt disconnection was improved enormously
by the introduction of relay manual boards. Just before
the installation of relay boards in New York City, the average disconnecting
time was over seventeen seconds. On the completion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[Page 307]</a></span>of an entire relay equipment, the average disconnecting time was
found to be under three seconds. The introduction of relay manual
apparatus has led subscribers to a larger traffic and to the making
of calls which succeed each other very closely. A most important
rule is, <i>that disconnect signals shall be given prompt attention either
by the operator who made the connection, by an operator adjacent,
or by a monitor who may be assisting</i>; and another, still more important
one is, <i>that a flashing keyboard lamp indicating a recall shall be
given precedence over all originating and all other disconnect signals</i>.</p>

<p><i>Accuracy and Promptness.</i> Promptness and accuracy in connecting
with the called line are vital, and yet a large percentage of
errors in these elements might exist in an exchange having a very
high average speed of answering the originating call. Indeed, it
seems quite the rule that where the effort of the management is devoted
toward securing and maintaining extreme speed of original
answering, all the other elements suffer in due proportion.</p>

<p><i>Courtesy and Form.</i> It goes without saying that operators should
be courteous; but it is necessary to say it, and keep saying it in the
most effective form, in order to prevent human nature under the
most exasperating circumstances from lapsing a little from the standard,
however high. The use of form assists both the operators and
the subscribers, because in all matters of strict routine it is much
easier to secure high speed and great accuracy by making as many
as possible of the operations automatic. The use of the word "number"
and other well-accepted formalities has assisted greatly in securing
speed, clear understanding, and accurate performance. The
simple expedient of spelling numbers by repeating the figures in a
detached form&mdash;as "1-2-5" for 125&mdash;has taught subscribers the same
expedient, and the percentage of possible error is materially reduced
by going one step further and having the operator, in repeating, use
always the opposite form from that spoken by the calling subscriber.</p>

<p><i>Busy and Don't Answer Calls.</i> Notwithstanding the old impression
of the public to the contrary, the operator has no control over
the "busy line" and "don't answer" situation. It is, however, of
high importance that the management should know, by the analysis of
repeated and exhaustive tests of the service, to what extent these
troubles are degrading it. In addition to improving the service by
the elimination of busy reports, there is no means of increasing revenue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[Page 308]</a></span>which is so easy and so certain as that which comes from following
up the tabulated results of busy calls.</p>

<p><i>Enunciation.</i> It must be remembered that clear enunciation
for telephone purposes is a matter wholly relative, and the ability of
an operator in this regard can be determined only by a close analysis
of many observations from the standpoint of a subscriber. A trick
of speech rather than a pleasant voice and an easy address has made
the answering ability of many an operator captivating to a group of
satisfied subscribers.</p>

<p><i>Team Work.</i> By team work is meant the ability of a group of
operators, seated side by side, to work together as a unit in caring for
the service brought to them by the answering jacks within their reach.
In switchboards of the construction usual today, a call before any
operator may be answered by her, or by the operator at either the
right or the left of her position. In many exchanges this advantage
is wholly overlooked. In the period of general re-design of central-office
equipments about fourteen years ago, a switchboard was installed
with mechanical visual signals and answering-jacks on a
flat-top board, and an arrangement of operators such that the signal
of any call was extremely prominent and in easy reach of each one of
four or possibly five operators. Associated with the line signals within
the reach of such a group was an auxiliary lamp signal which would
light when a call was made by any of the lines so terminating. It was
found that with this arrangement the calls were answered in a strictly
even manner, special rushes being cared for by the joint efforts of
the group rather than serving to swamp the operator who happened
to be in charge of the particular section affected by the rush.</p>

<p>This principle has been tried out in so many ways that it is astonishing
that it is not recognized as being a vital one. The whole
matter is accomplished by impressing upon each operator that her
duty is, <i>not</i> to answer the calls of a specific number of lines before her,
but to answer, with such promptness as is possible, <i>any call which
is within the reach of her answering equipment</i>.</p>

<p><b>Observation of Service.</b> All that is required to be known concerning
the form of address and courtesy may be learned by a close
observation of the operators' work by the chief operators and monitors,
and by the use of listening circuits permanently connected to the
operators' sets. It is naturally necessary that the use of these listening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[Page 309]</a></span>circuits by the chief operator or her assistants must not be known
to the operators at the times of use, even though they may know of
the existence of such facilities.</p>

<p>With a well-designed and properly maintained automatic equipment,
the eight elements of good manual service reduce themselves
to only one or two. Freedom from failure by busy lines and failure to
answer are service-qualities independent of the kind of switching
apparatus. Too great a percentage of busy calls for a given line indicates
that the telephone facilities for calls incoming to that subscriber
are inadequate. The best condition would be for each subscriber
to have lines enough so that none of them ever would be found
busy. This is the condition the telephone company tries to establish
between its various offices.</p>

<p>In manual practice it is possible to keep such records as will enable
the traffic department to know when the lines to a subscriber
are insufficient for the traffic trying to reach him. As soon as such
facts are known, they can be laid before the subscriber so that he may
arrange for additional incoming lines. In automatic practice this is
not so simple, as the source and destination of traffic in general is
not so clearly known to the traffic department. Automatic recorders
of busy calls are necessary to enable the facts to be tabulated.</p>

<span style="font-size:80%;">MEASURED SERVICE</span></h2>


<p>In the commercial relation between the public and a telephone
system, the commodity which is produced by the latter and consumed
by the former is telephone service. Users often consider that payment
is made for rental of telephone apparatus and to some persons
the payment per month seems large for the rental of a mere telephone
which could be bought outright for a few dollars.</p>

<p>The telephone instrument is but a small part of the physical
property used by a patron of a telephone system. Even the <i>entire</i>
group of property elements used by a patron in receiving telephone
service represents much less than what really is his proportion of the
service-rendering effort. What the patron receives is service and
its value during a time depends largely on how much of it he uses
in that time, and less on the number of telephones he can call.</p>

<p><i>The cost of telephone service varies as the amount of use.</i> It is
just, therefore, that the selling price should vary as the amount of use.</p>

<p><b>Rates.</b> There are two general methods of charging for telephone
service and of naming rates for this charge. These are called flat rates
and measured-service rates. The latter are also known as message
rates, because the message or conversation is the unit. Flat rates
are those which are also known as rentals. The service furnished
under flat rates is also known as unlimited service, for the reason that
under it a patron pays the same amount each month and is entitled to
hold as many conversations&mdash;send as many messages and make as
many calls&mdash;as he wishes, without any additional payment. In the
measured-service plan, the amount of payment in a month varies in
some way with the amount of use, depending on the plan adopted.
The patron may pay a fixed base amount per month, entitling him
to have equipment for telephone service and to receive messages, but
being required to pay, in addition to this base amount, a sum which
is determined by the number of messages which he sends. Or he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[Page 311]</a></span>may pay a base amount per month and be entitled to have the equipment,
to receive calls, and to send a certain number of messages,
paying specifically in addition only for messages exceeding that certain
number.</p>

<p>Whether flat rates or measured-service rates are practiced, the
general tendency is to establish lower rates for service in homes than
in business places. This is another recognition of the justice of
graduating the rates in accordance with the amount of use.</p>

<p><b>Units of Charging.</b> While both the flat-rate and the measured-rate
methods of charging for unlimited and measured service are
practiced in local exchanges, long-distance service universally is sold
at message rates. The unit of message rates in long-distance service
is time. The charge for a message between two points joined
by long-distance lines usually is a certain sum for a conversation
three minutes long plus a certain sum for each additional minute or
fraction of a minute. In local service, the message-rate time charge
per message takes less account of the time unit. The conversation is
almost universally the unit in exchanges. Some managements restrict
messages of multi-party lines to five minutes per conversation,
because of the desire to avoid withholding the line from other parties
upon it for too long periods. Service sold at public stations similarly
is restricted as to time, even though the message be local to the exchange.
Three to five minutes local conversation is sold generally
for five cents in the United States. The time of the average local
message, counting actual conversation time only, is one hundred seconds.</p>

<p><b>Toll Service.</b> <i>Long Haul.</i> In long-distance service, there are
two general methods of handling traffic, as to the relations between
the calling and the called stations. For the greater distances, as
between cities not closely related because not belonging to one
general community, the calling patron calls a particular person and
pays nothing unless he holds conversation with that person. In
this method, the operator records the name of the person called
for; the name, telephone number, or both, of the person calling; the
names of the towns where the message originated and ended; the
date, the time conversation began, and the length of time it lasted.</p>

<p><i>Short Haul.</i> Where towns are closely related in commercial
and social ways and where the traffic is large and approaches local
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Page 312]</a></span>service in character, and yet where conversations between them
are charged at different rates than are local calls within them, a
more rapid system of toll charging than that just described is of advantage.
In these conditions, patrons are not sold a service which
allows a particular party to be named and found, nor is the identity
of the calling person required. The operator needs to know merely
of these calls that they originate at a certain telephone and are for
a certain other. The facts she must record are fewer and her work
is simpler. Therefore, the cost of such switching is less than for
true long-distance calls and it can be learned by careful auditing
just when traffic between points becomes great enough to warrant
switching them in this way. Such switching, for example, exists
between New York and Brooklyn, between Chicago and suburbs
around it which have names of their own but really are part of the
community of Chicago, and between San Francisco and other cities
which cluster around San Francisco Bay.</p>

<p>Calls of the "long-haul" class are known as "particular person"
or "particular party" calls, while "short-haul" calls are known as
"two-number" long-distance calls. It is customary to handle particular
party calls on long-distance switchboards and to handle two-number
calls in manual systems on subscribers' switchboards exactly
like local calls, except that the two-number calls are ticketed. It is
customary in automatic systems to handle two-number calls by
means of the regular automatic equipment plus ticketing by a suburban
or two-number operator.</p>

<p><i>Timing Toll Connections.</i> It formerly was customary to measure
the time of long-distance conversations by noting on the ticket
the time of its beginning and the time of its ending, the operator
reading the time from a clock. For human and physical reasons,
such timing seems not to be considered infallible by the patron
who pays the charge, and in cases of dispute concerning overtime
charges so timed, telephone companies find it wisest to make concessions.
The physical cause of error in reading time from a clock
is that of parallax; that is, the error which arises from the fact that
the minute hand of a clock is some distance from the surface of the
dial so that one can "look under it." On an ordinary clock having
a large face and its minute hand pointing upward or downward,
five people standing in a row could read five different times from it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Page 313]</a></span>at the same instant. The middle person might see the minute hand
pointing at 6, indicating the time to be half-past something; whereas,
person No. 1 and person No. 5 in the row might read the time
respectively 29 and 31 minutes past something. Operators far to
the right or to the left of a clock will get different readings, and an
operator below a clock will get different kinds of readings at different
times and correct readings at few times.</p>

<p>Timing Machines:&mdash;Machines which record time directly on
long-distance tickets are of value and machines which automatically
compute the time elapsing during a conversation are of much greater
value. The calculagraph is a machine of the latter class. The
use of some such machine uniformly reduces controversy as to time
which really elapsed. Parallax errors are avoided. The record
possesses a dignity which carries conviction.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig453_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 453. Calculagraph Records</b><br />
<a href="images/fig453.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Calculagraph records are shown in Fig. 453. In the one
shown in the upper portion of this figure, the conversation began
at 10.44 <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> This is shown by the right-hand dial of the
three which constitute the record. The minutes past 10 o'clock
are shown by the hand within the dial and the hour 10 is shown
by the triangular mark just outside the dial between X and XI.</p>

<p>The duration of the conversation is shown by the middle and
the left-hand dials. The figures on both these dials indicate minutes.
The middle dial indicates roughly that the conversation lasted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[Page 314]</a></span>for a time between 0 and 5 minutes. The left-hand dial indicates
with greater exactness that the conversation lasted one and one-quarter
minutes.</p>

<p>The hand of the left-hand dial makes one revolution in five
minutes; of the middle dial, one revolution in an hour. The middle
dial tells how many full periods of five minutes have elapsed
and the left-hand dial shows the excess over the five-minute interval.</p>

<p>The lower portion of Fig. 453 is a similar record beginning at
the same time of day, but lasting about five and one-half minutes.
As before, the readings of the two dials are added to get the
elapsed time.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 454. Relative Position of Hands and Dials</b><br />
<a href="images/fig454.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The right-hand dial, showing merely time of day, stands still
while its hands revolve. The dies which print the dials and hands
of the middle and the left-hand records rotate together. Examining
the machine, one finds that the hands of these dials always
point to zero. The middle dial and hand make one complete revolution
in an hour; the left-hand dial and hand, one in five minutes.
In making the records, the dials are printed at the beginning and
the hands at the end of the conversation. Therefore, the hands
will have moved forward during the conversation&mdash;still pointing to
zero in both cases&mdash;but when printed the hands will point to some
other place than they were pointing when the dials were printed.
In this way, their angular distances truly indicate the lapse of time.
Fig. 454 shows the relative position of the hands and dials within
the machine at all times. It will be noted that the arrow of the
left-hand dial does not point exactly to zero. This is due to the
fact that the dials and hands are printed by separate operations
and cannot be printed simultaneously.</p>

<p>Another method of timing toll connections has been developed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Page 315]</a></span>by the Monarch Telephone Manufacturing Company. This employs
a master clock of great accuracy, which may be mounted on
the wall anywhere in the building or another building if desired. A
circuit leads from this clock to a time-stamp device on the operator's
key shelf, and the clock closes this circuit every quarter minute.
The impulses thus sent over the circuit energize the magnet of the
time stamp, which steps a train of printing wheels around so as always
to keep them set in such position as to properly print the correct
time on a ticket whenever the head of the stamp is moved by the
operator into contact with the ticket. A large number of such stamps
may be operated from the same master clock. By printing the starting
time of a connection below the finishing
time the computation of lapsed
time becomes a matter of subtraction. A
typical toll ticket with the beginning and
ending time printed by the time stamp
in the upper left-hand corner and the
elapsed time recorded by hand in the upper
right-hand corner is shown in Fig. 455.
It is seen that this stamp records in the
order mentioned the month, the day, the
hour, the minute and quarter minute, the
<span class="smcap">a.m.</span> and <span class="smcap">p.m.</span> division of the day, and the
year.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig455_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 455. Toll Ticket Used with Monarch System</b><br />
<a href="images/fig455.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>An interesting feature of this system
is that the same master clock may be
made in a similar manner to actuate secondary
clocks placed at subscribers' stations, the impulses being
sent over wires in the same cables as those containing the subscribers'
lines. This system, therefore, serves not only as a means for
timing the toll tickets and operating time stamps wherever they are
required in the business of the telephone company, but also to supply
a general clock and time-stamp service to the patrons of the telephone
company as a "by-product" of the general telephone business.</p>

<p>Exchange service is measured in terms of conversations without
much regard to their length. The payment for the service
may be made at the time it is received, as in public stations and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Page 316]</a></span>at telephones equipped with coin prepayment devices; or the calls
from a telephone may be recorded and collection for them made at
agreed intervals. In the prepayment method the price per call
is uniform. In the deferred payment method the calls are recorded
as they are made, their number summed up at intervals, and the
amount due determined by the price per call. The price per call
may vary with the number of calls sold. A large user may have
a lower rate per call than a small user.</p>

<p><b>Local Service.</b> <i>Ticket Method.</i> Measured local service sometimes
is recorded by means of tickets, similarly to the described
method of charging long-distance calls, except that the time of day
and the duration of conversation are not so important. Where
local ticketing is practiced, it is usual to write on the ticket only
the number of the calling telephone and the date, and to pass into
the records only those tickets which represent actual conversations,
keeping out tickets representing calls for busy lines and calls which
were not answered.</p>

<p><i>Meter Method.</i> The requirements of speed in good local service
are opposed to the ticketing method. Where measured service
is supplied to a substantial proportion of the lines of a large exchange,
electro-mechanical service meters are attached to the lines. These
service meters register as a consequence of some act on the part of
the switchboard operator, or may be caused to register by the answering
of the called subscriber.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig456_t.jpg" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 456. Connection Meter</b><br />
<a href="images/fig456.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>In manual practice, meters of the type shown in Fig. 456 are
associated with the lines as in Fig. 457. The meters are mounted
separately from the switchboard,
needing only to be connected to
the test-strand of the line by
cabled wires. If desired, the meter
may be mounted on racks in
quarters especially devoted to
them, and the cases in which the
racks are mounted may be kept locked. In such an arrangement
the meters are read from time to time through the glass doors of
the cases.</p>

<p>The meters are caused to operate by pressure on the meter
key <i>MK</i>, associated with the answering cord as in Fig. 458. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Page 317]</a></span>increases the normal potential to 30 volts. When the armature of
the meter has made a part of its stroke, it closes a contact which
places its 40-ohm winding in shunt with its 500-ohm winding, thus
furnishing ample power for turning the meter wheels.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig457_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 457. Western Electric Line Circuit and Service Meter</b><br />
<a href="images/fig457.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Such meters are in common use in large exchanges, notable
examples being the cities of New York and London. In London,
there is a zone within which the price per call is one penny and
between which and other zones the price is twopence. Calls within
the zone either are completed by the answering operator directly
in the multiple before her or are trunked to other offices in that
zone. Calls for points outside of that zone are trunked to other
offices and in giving the order the operator finds that the call circuit
key lights a special signal lamp before her. This reminds her that
the call is at a twopence price, so in recording it she presses the
meter key twice. This counts two units on the meter and the units
are billed at a penny each.</p>

<p>In automatic systems it is not possible to operate a meter system
in which the operator will press a key for each call to be charged,
because there is no operator. In such systems&mdash;a notable example
being the measured-service automatic system in San Francisco&mdash;the
meter registers only upon the answering of the called subscriber.
Calls for lines found busy and calls which are not answered do not
register. Calls for long-distance recording operators, two-number
ticket operators, information, complaint, and other company departments
are not registered. In the Chinatown quarter of San
Francisco, where most calls begin and end in the neighborhood,
service is sold at an unlimited flat rate for neighborhood calls and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Page 318]</a></span>at a message rate for other calls. The meter system recognizes this
condition and does not register calls <i>from</i> Chinese subscribers <i>for</i>
Chinese subscribers, though it does register calls from Chinese
subscribers to Caucasian subscribers. The nature of the system
is such as to enable it to discriminate as to races, localities, or other
peculiarities as may be desired.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<a href="images/fig458.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>In the manual meter circuits of Figs. 457 and 458, the meter
windings have no relation to the line conductors. In the automatic
arrangement just described, there are meter windings in the
line during times of calling, but none in the line during times of conversation.
The balance of the line, therefore, is undisturbed at all
times wherein balance is of any importance.</p>

<p>In both systems just described, the meters of all lines are in
their respective central offices. Meters for use at subscribers'
stations have been devised and there is no fundamental reason why
the record might not be made at the subscriber's station instead of,
or in addition to, a central-office record. Experience has shown
that confidence in a meter system can be secured if the meters be
positive, accurate, and reliable. The labor of reading the meters
is much less when they are kept in central offices. Subscribers
may have access to them if they wish.</p>

<p><i>Prepayment Method.</i> Prepayment measured-service mechanisms
permit a coin or token to be dropped into a machine at the
subscriber's telephone at the time the conversation is held. A
variety of forms of telephone coin collectors are in use, their operations
being fundamentally either electrical or mechanical.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[Page 319]</a></span></p><p>Electrically operated coin collectors require either that the
coin be dropped into the machine in order to enable the central office
to be signaled in manual systems, or the switches to be operated in
automatic systems, or they require that the coin be dropped into
the machine after calling, but before the conversation is permitted.</p>

<p>Western Electric Company coin collectors, shown in Fig. 459,
may be operated in either way in connection with manual systems.
The usual way is to require the coin to be dropped before the central-office
line lamp can glow. The operator then rings the called
subscriber and upon his answering places a sufficient potential upon
the calling line to operate the polarized relay and to drop the coin
into the cash box. If the called subscriber does not answer or his
line is busy, potential is placed on the calling line, moving the polarized
relay in the other direction and dropping the coin into a return
chute so that the subscriber may take it. If it is preferred that
the coin be paid only on the request of the operator, the return feature
need not be provided.</p>

<p>In both forms of operation, the Western Electric coin collector
is adapted to bridge its polarized relay between one limb of the line
and ground during the time a
coin rests on the pins, as shown
in Fig. 459. When no coin is on
the pins&mdash;<i>i. e.</i>, before calling and
after the called station responds&mdash;the
relay is not so bridged.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig459_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 459. Principle of Western Electric Coin Collector</b><br />
<a href="images/fig459.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The armature of the relay
responds only to a high potential
and this is applied by the operator.
If the coin is to be taken
by the company, one polarity is
sent; if it is to be returned to the
patron, the other polarity is sent.
These polarities are applied to a
limb of the line proper. It will
be recalled that pressures to actuate service meters are applied to
the test-strand. If wished, keys may be arranged so as to apply
30 volts to the test-strand and the collecting potential to the line at
the same operation. This enables the service meter to count the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[Page 320]</a></span>tokens placed in the cash box of the coin collector, and serves as a
valuable check.</p>

<p>In automatic systems, in one arrangement, coin collectors
are arranged so that no impulses can be sent unless a coin has been
deposited, the coin automatically passing to the cash box when the
called subscriber answers, or to the patron if it is not answered.
In another arrangement, calls are made exactly as in unlimited
service, but a coin must be deposited before a conversation can
be held. The calling person can hear the called party speak and
may speak himself but can not be heard until the coin is deposited.
No coin-return mechanism is required in this method.</p>

<p>Coin collectors of these types usually are adapted to receive
only one kind of coin, these, in the United States, being either nickels
or dimes. For long-distance service, where the charges vary, it
is necessary to signal to an operator just what coins are paid. It
is uniformly customary to send these signals by sound, the collector
being so arranged that the coins strike gongs. In coin collectors
of the Gray Telephone Paystation Company, the coins strike
these gongs by their own weight in falling through chutes. In coin
collectors of the Baird Electric Company, the power for the signals
is provided by hand power, a lever being pulled for each coin
deposited. Both methods are in wide use.</p>

<span style="font-size:80%;">PHANTOM, SIMPLEX, AND COMPOSITE CIRCUITS</span></h2>


<p><b>Definitions.</b> Phantom circuits are arrangements of telephone
wires whereby more working, non-interfering telephone lines exist
than there are sets of actual wires. When four wires are arranged
to provide three metallic circuits for telephone purposes, two of the
lines are physical circuits and one is a phantom circuit.</p>

<p>Simplex and composite circuits are arrangements of wires
whereby telephony and telegraphy can take place at the same time
over the same wires without interference.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig460_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 460. Phantom Circuit</b><br />
<a href="images/fig460.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><b>Phantom.</b> In Fig. 460 four wires join two offices. <i>RR</i> are
repeating coils, designed for efficient transforming of both talking
and ringing currents. The devices marked <i>A</i> in this and the following
figures are air-gap arresters. Currents from the telephones
connected to either physical pair of wires pass, at any instant, in opposite
directions in the two wires of the pair. The phantom circuit
uses one of the physical pairs as a <i>wire</i> of its line. It does this by
tapping the middle point of the line side of each of the repeating
coils. The impedance of the repeating-coil winding is lowered because,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[Page 322]</a></span>all the windings being on the same core, the phantom line
currents pass from the middle to the outer connections so as to
neutralize each other's influence. The currents of the phantom circuit,
unlike those of the physical circuits, are <i>in the same direction</i>
in both wires of a pair at any instant. Their potentials, therefore,
are equal and simultaneous.</p>

<p>A phantom circuit is formed most simply when both physical
lines end in the same two offices. If one physical line is longer than
the other, a phantom circuit may be formed as in Fig. 461, wherein
the repeating coil is inserted in the longer line where it passes through
a terminal station of the shorter.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 461. Phantom from Two Physical Circuits of Unequal Length</b><br />
<a href="images/fig461.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>A circuit may be built up by adding a physical circuit to a
phantom. A circuit may be made up of two or more phantom
circuits, joined by physical ones. In Fig. 462 a phantom circuit is
extended by the use of a physical circuit, while in Fig. 463, two
phantom circuits are joined by placing between them a physical
circuit.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[Page 323]</a></span></p><p><i>Transpositions.</i> In phantom circuits formed merely by inserting
repeating coils in physical circuits and doing nothing else,
an exact balance of the sides of the phantom circuit is lacking. The
resistances, insulations, and capacities to earth of the sides may be
equal, but the exposures to adjacent telephone and telegraph circuits
and to power circuits will not be equal unless the phantom circuits
are transposed.</p>

<p>To transpose a set of lines of two physical wires each, is not
complicated, though it must be done with care and in accordance
with a definite, foreknown plan. Transposing phantom circuits
is less simple, however, as four wires per circuit have to be transposed,
instead of two.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig464_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 464. Transposition of Phantom Circuits</b><br />
<a href="images/fig464.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>In Fig. 464, the general spacing of transposition sections is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Page 324]</a></span>the usual one, 1,300 feet, of the <i>ABCB</i> system widely in use. The
pole circuit, on pins <i>5</i> and <i>6</i> of the upper arm, is transposed once
each two miles. The pole circuit of the second arm transposes
either once or twice a mile. But neither pole circuit differs in transposition
from any other regular scheme except in the frequency of
transposition. All the other wires of each arm, however, are so
arranged that each wire on either side of the pole circuit moves
from pin to pin at section-ends, till it has completed a cycle of changes
over all four of the pins on its side. In doing so, each phantom circuit
is transposed with proper regard to each of the other three on
that twenty-wire line.</p>

<p>The "new transposition" lettering in Fig. 464 is for the purpose
of identifying the exact scheme of wiring each transposition
pole. The complication of wiring at each transposition pole is
increased by the adoption of phantom circuits. Maintenance of
all the circuits is made more costly and less easy unless the work
at points of transposition is done with care and skill. Phantom
circuits, to be always successful, require that the physical circuits
be balanced and kept so.</p>

<p><i>Transmission over Phantom Circuits.</i> Under proper conditions
phantom circuits are better than physical circuits, and in this
respect it may be noted that some long-distance operating companies
instruct their operators always to give preference to phantom
circuits, because of the better transmission over them. The use of
phantom circuits is confined almost wholly to open-wire circuits;
and while the capacity of the phantom circuit is somewhat greater
than that of the physical circuit, its resistance is considerably smaller.
In the actual wire the phantom loop is only half the resistance of
either of the physical lines from which it is made, for it contains
twice as much copper. The resistance of the repeating coils, however,
is to be added.</p>

<p><b>Simplex.</b> Simplex telegraph circuits are made from metallic
circuit telephone lines, as shown in Fig. 465. The principle is
identical with that of phantom telephone circuits. The potentials
placed on the telephone line by the telegraph operations are equal
and simultaneous. They cause no current to flow <i>around</i> the telephone
loop, only <i>along</i> it. If all qualities of the loop are balanced,
the telephones will not overhear the telegraph impulses. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[Page 325]</a></span>figure, <i>AA</i> are arresters, as before, <i>GG</i> are Morse relays; a 2-microfarad
condenser is shunted around the contact of each Morse key
<i>F</i> to quench the noises due to the sudden changes on opening the
keys between dots and dashes.</p>

the Morse circuit is the same. An advantage of such a circuit,
as shown in Fig. 466, is that the telephone circuit does not suffer
from the two repeating-coil losses in series. A disadvantage is, that
in ringing on such a line with a grounded generator, the Morse relays
are caused to chatter.</p>

<p>The circuit of Fig. 465 may be made to fit the condition of a
through telephone line and a way telegraph station. The midway
Morse apparatus of Fig. 467 is looped in by a combination of impedance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[Page 326]</a></span>coils and condensers. The plans of Figs. 465 and 466
here are combined, with the further idea of stopping direct and
passing alternating currents, as is so well accomplished by the use
of condensers.</p>

<br /><b>Fig. 468. Composite Circuit</b><br />
<a href="images/fig468.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><b>Composite.</b> Composite circuits depend on another principle
than that of producing equal and simultaneous potentials on the
two wires of the telephone loop. The opposition of impedance
coils to alternating currents and of condensers to direct currents
are the fundamentals. The early work in this art was done by
Van Rysselberghe, of Belgium. In Fig. 468, one telephone circuit
forms two Morse circuits, two wires carrying three services. Each
Morse circuit will be seen to include, serially, two 50-ohm impedance
coils, and to have shunts through condensers to ground. The 50-ohm
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[Page 327]</a></span>coils are connected differentially, offering low consequent impedance
to Morse impulses, whose frequency of interruption is not
great. As the impedance coils are large, have cores of considerable
length, and are wound with two separate though serially connected
windings each, their impedance to voice currents is great. They
act as though they were not connected differentially, so far as voice
currents are concerned.</p>

<p>Because of the condensers serially in the telephone line, voice
currents can pass through it, but direct currents can not. Impulses
due to discharges of cores, coils, and capacities in the Morse
circuit <i>could</i> make sounds in the telephones, but these are choked
out, or led to earth by the 30-ohm impedance coils and the heavy
Morse condensers.</p>

<p><b>Ringing.</b> Ringing over simplex circuits is done in the way
usual where no telegraph service is added. Both telegraphy and
telephony over simplex circuits follow their usual practice in the
way of calling and conversing. In composite working, however,
ringing by usual methods either is impossible because of heavy
grounds and shunts, or if it is possible to get ringing signals through
at all, the relays of the Morse apparatus will chatter, interfering
with the proper use of the telegraph portion of the service.</p>

<p>It is customary, therefore, either to equip composite circuits
with special signaling devices by which high-frequency currents
pass over the telephone circuits, operating relays which in turn operate
local ringing signals; or to refrain from ringing on composite
circuits and to transmit orders for connections by telegraph. The
latter is wholly satisfactory over composite lines between points
having heavy telegraph traffic, and it is between such points as these
that composite practice is most general.</p>

<p><b>Phantoms from Simplex and Composite Circuits.</b> Phantom and
simplex principles are identical, and by adding the composite principle,
two simplex circuits may have a phantom superadded, as in
Fig. 469. Similarly, as in Fig. 470, two composite circuits can be
phantomed. This case gives seven distinct services over four wires:
three telephone loops&mdash;two physical and one phantom&mdash;and four
Morse lines.</p>

<p><b>Railway Composite.</b> The foregoing are problems of making
telegraphy a by-product of telephony. With so many telegraph
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[Page 329]</a></span>wires on poles over the country, it has seemed a pity not to turn the
thing around and provide for telephony as a by-product of telegraphy.
This has been accomplished, and the result is called a railway composite
system. For the reason that the telegraph circuits are not
in pairs, accurately matched one wire against another, and are not
always uniform as to material, it has not been possible to secure
as good telephone circuits from telegraph wires as telegraph circuits
from telephone wires.</p>

<p>Practical results are secured by adaptation of the original principle
of different frequencies. A study of Fig. 468 shows that over
such a composite circuit the usual method of ringing from station
to station over the telephone circuit
by an alternating current of
a frequency of about sixteen per
second is practically impossible.
This is because of the heavy short-circuit
provided by the two 30-ohm
choke coils at each of the stations,
the heavy shunt of the large
condensers, and the grounding
through the 50-ohm choke coils.
If high-frequency speech currents
can pass over these circuits with
a very small loss, other high-frequency
circuits should find a
good path. There are many easy ways of making such currents,
but formerly none very simple for receiving them. Fig. 471 shows
one simple observer of such high-frequency currents, it being merely
an adaptation of the familiar polarized ringer used in every subscriber's
telephone. In either position of the armature it makes
contact with one or the other of two studs connected to the battery,
so that in all times of rest the relay <i>A</i> is energized. When a
high-frequency current passes through this polarized relay, however,
there is enough time in which the armature is out of contact with
either stud to reduce the total energy through the relay <i>A</i> and allow
its armature to fall away, ringing a vibrating bell or giving some
other signal.</p>

<p>Fig. 472 shows a form of apparatus for producing the high-frequency
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[Page 330]</a></span>current necessary for signaling. It is evident that if a
magneto generator, such as is used in ordinary magneto telephones,
could be made to drive its armature fast enough, it also might furnish
the high-frequency current necessary for signaling through
condensers and past heavy impedances.</p>

<p>Applying these principles of
high-frequency signals sent and
received to a single-wire telegraph
circuit, the arrangement shown
in Fig. 473 results, this being a
type of railway composite circuit.
The principal points of interest herein are the insertion of impedances
in series with the telegraph lines, the shunting of the telegraph relays
by small condensers, the further shunting of the whole telegraph
mechanism of a station by another condenser, and thus keeping out
of the line circuit changes in current values which would be heard
in the telephones if violent, and might be inaudible if otherwise.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig473_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 473. Railway Composite Circuit</b><br />
<a href="images/fig473.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>A further interesting element is the very heavy shunting of the
telephone receiver by means of an inductive coil. This shunt is
applied for by-path purposes so that heavy disturbing currents
may be kept out of the receiver while a sufficient amount of voice
current is diverted through the receiver. It is well to have the inductance
of this shunt made adjustable by providing a movable iron
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[Page 331]</a></span>core for the shunt winding. When the core is drawn out of the
coil, its impedance is diminished because the inductance is diminished.
This reduces the amount of disturbing noise in the receiver.
The core should be withdrawn as little as the amount of disturbance
permits, as this also diminishes the loudness of the received speech.</p>

<p>Because the signaling over lines equipped with this form of composite
working results in the ringing of a bell by means of local current,
it is of particular advantage in cases where the bell needs to
ring loudly. Switch stations, crossings, and similar places where the
attendant is not constantly near the telephone can be equipped with
this type of composite apparatus and it so offers a valuable substitute
for regular railway telegraph equipment, with which the attendant
may not be familiar. The success of the local bell-ringing
arrangement, however, depends on accurate relay adjustment and
on the maintenance of a primary battery. The drain on the ringing
battery is greater than on the talking battery.</p>

<p>A good substitute for the bell signal on railway composite circuits
is a telephone receiver responding directly to high-frequency
currents over the line. The receiver is designed specially for the
purpose and is known as a "howler." Its signal can be easily heard
through a large room. The condenser in series with it is of small
capacity, limiting the drain upon the line. Usually the howler is
detached by the switch hook during conversation from a station.</p>

<p><i>Railway Composite Set.</i> The circuit of a set utilizing such an
arrangement together with other details of a complete railway composite
set is shown in Fig. 474. The drawing is arranged thus, in
the hope of simplifying the understanding of its principles. It will be
seen that the induction coil serves as an interrupter as well as for transmission.
All of the contacts are shown in the position they have
during conversation. The letters <i>Hc1</i>, <i>Hc2</i>, etc., and <i>Kc1</i>, <i>Kc2</i>,
etc., refer to hook contacts and key contacts, respectively, of the numbers
given. The arrangements of the hook and key springs are shown
at the right of the figure. <i>RR</i> represent impedance coils connected
serially in the line and placed at terminal stations. The composite
telephone sets are bridged from the line to ground at any points
between the terminal impedance coils.</p>

<p>The direct currents of telegraphy are prevented from passing
to ground through the telephone set during conversation by the 2-microfarad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Page 332]</a></span>condenser which is in series with the receiver. They are
prevented from passing to ground through the telephone set when the
receiver is on the hook by a .05 microfarad condenser in series with the
howler. The alternating currents of speech and interrupter signaling
are kept from passing to ground at terminals by the impedance coils.</p>

<p>Signals are sent from the set by pressing the key <i>K</i>. This operates
the vibrator by closing contacts <i>Kc6</i> and <i>Kc7</i>. The howler
is cut off and the receiver is short-circuited by the same operation of
the key. The impedance of the coil <i>I</i> is changed by moving its
adjustable core.</p>

<p><b>Applications.</b> A chief use of composite and simplex circuits
is for ticket wire purposes. These are circuits over which long-distance
operators instruct each other as to connecting and disconnecting
lines, the routing of calls, and the making of appointments.
One such wire will care for all the business of many long-distance
trunks. The public also absorbs the telegraph product of telephone
lines. Such telegraph service is leased to brokers, manufacturers,
merchants, and newspapers. Railway companies use portable telephone
adjuncts to telegraph circuits on trains for service from
stations not able to support telegraph attendants, and in a limited
degree for the dispatching of trains. Telephone train dispatching,
however, merits better equipment than a railway composite system
affords.</p>

<span style="font-size:80%;">TELEPHONE TRAIN DISPATCHING<a name="FNanchor_A_4" id="FNanchor_A_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_A_4" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></span></h2>


<p>It has been only within the past three few that the telephone
has begun to replace the telegraph for handling train movements.
The telegraph and the railroads have grown up together in this country
since 1850, and in view of the excellent results that the telegraph
has given in train dispatching and of the close alliance that has
always naturally existed between the railway and the telegraph, it has
been difficult for the telephone, which came much later, to enter the
field.</p>

<p><b>Rapid Growth.</b> The telephone has been in general use among
the railroads for many years, but only on a few short lines has it been
used for dispatching trains. In these cases the ordinary magneto
circuit and instruments have been employed, differing in no respect
from those used in commercial service at the present time. Code
ringing was used and the number of stations on a circuit was limited
by the same causes that limit the telephones on commercial party
lines at present.</p>

<p>The present type of telephone dispatching systems, however,
differs essentially from the systems used in commercial work, and is,
in fact, a highly specialized party-line system, arranged for selective
ringing and <i>many stations</i>. The first of the present type was installed
by the New York Central and Hudson River Railroad in October,
1907, between Albany and Fonda, New York, a distance of
40 miles. This section of the road is on the main line and has four
tracks controlled by block signals.</p>

<p>The Chicago, Burlington, and Quincy Railroad was the second to
install train-dispatching circuits. In December, 1907, a portion of the
main line from Aurora to Mendota, Illinois, a distance of 46 miles,
was equipped. This was followed in quick succession by various
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[Page 334]</a></span>other circuits ranging, in general, in lengths over 100 miles. At the
present time there are over 20 train-dispatching circuits on the Chicago,
Burlington, and Quincy Railroad covering 125 miles of double
track, 28 miles of multi-track, and 1,381 miles of single track, and
connecting with 286 stations.</p>

<p>Other railroads entered this field in quick order after the initial
installations, and at the present time nearly every large railroad system
in the United States is equipped with several telephone train-dispatching
circuits and all of these seem to be extending their systems.</p>

<p>In 1910, several railroads, including the Delaware, Lackawanna,
and Western, had their total mileage equipped with telephone dispatching
circuits. The Atchison, Topeka, and Santa Fe Railroad
is equipping its whole system as rapidly as possible and already is
the largest user of this equipment in this country. From latest
information, over 55 railroads have entered this field, with the result
that the telephone is now in use in railroad service on over
29,000 miles of line.</p>

<p><b>Causes of Its Introduction.</b> The reasons leading to the introduction
of the telephone into the dispatching field were of this nature:
First, and most important, was the enactment of State and Federal
Laws limiting to nine hours the working day of railroad employes
transmitting or receiving orders pertaining to the movement of trains.
The second, which is directly dependent upon the first, was the inability
of the railroads to obtain the additional number of telegraph
operators which were required under the provisions of the new laws.
It was estimated that 15,000 additional operators would be required
to maintain service in the same fashion after the new laws went into
effect in 1907. The increased annual expense occasioned by the
employment of these additional operators was roughly estimated
at $10,000,000. A third reason is found in the decreased efficiency
of the average railway and commercial telegraph operator. There
is a very general complaint among the railroads today regarding this
particular point, and many of them welcome the telephone, because,
if for no other reason, it renders them independent of the telegrapher.
What has occasioned this decrease in efficiency it is not easy to say,
but there is a strong tendency to lay it, in part, to the attitude of the
telegraphers' organization toward the student operator. It is a fact,
too, that the limits which these organizations have placed on student
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[Page 335]</a></span>operators were directly responsible for the lack of available men
when they were needed.</p>

<p><b>Advantages.</b> In making this radical change, railroad officials
were most cautious, and yet we know of no case where the introduction
of the telephone has been followed by its abandonment, the
tendency having been in all cases toward further installations and
more equipment of the modern type. The reasons for this are clear,
for where the telephone is used it does not require a highly specialized
man as station operator and consequently a much broader field
is open to the railroads from which to draw operators. This, we
think, is the most far-reaching advantage.</p>

<p>The telephone method also is faster. On an ordinary train-dispatching
circuit it now requires from 0.1 of a second to 5 seconds
to call any station. In case a plurality of calls is desired, the dispatcher
calls one station after another, getting the answer from one
while the next is being called, and so on. By speaking into a telephone
many more words may be transmitted in a given time than
by Morse telegraphy. It is possible to send fifty words a minute by
Morse, but such speed is exceptional. Less than half that is the rule.
The gain in high speed, therefore, which is obtained is obvious and
it has been found that this is a most important feature on busy divisions.
It is true that in the issuance of "orders," the speed, in
telephonic train dispatching, is limited to that required to write the
words in longhand. But all directions of a collateral character,
the receipt of important information, and the instantaneous descriptions
of emergency situations can be given and received at a speed
limited only by that of human speech.</p>

<p>The dispatcher is also brought into a closer personal relation
with the station men and trainmen, and this feature of direct personal
communication has been found to be of importance in bringing
about a higher degree of co-operation and better discipline in
the service.</p>

<p>Telephone dispatching has features peculiar to itself which
are important in improving the class of service. One of these is the
"answer-back" automatically given to the dispatcher by the waystation
bell. This informs the dispatcher whether or not the bell
at the station rang, and excuses by the operators that it did not, are
eliminated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[Page 336]</a></span></p><p>Anyone can answer a telephone call in an emergency. The
station operator is frequently agent also, and his duties often take
him out of hearing of the telegraph sounder. The selector bell
used with the telephone can be heard for a distance of several hundred
feet. In addition, it is quite likely that anyone in the neighborhood
would recognize that the station was wanted and either notify
the operator or answer the call.</p>

<p>In cases of emergency the train crews can get into direct communication
with the dispatcher immediately, by means of portable
telephone sets which are carried on the trains. It is a well-known
fact that every minute a main line is blocked by a wreck can be reckoned
as great loss to the railroad.</p>

<p>It is also possible to install siding telephone sets located either in
booths or on poles along the right-of-way. These are in general service
today at sidings, crossings, drawbridges, water tanks, and such
places, where it may be essential for a train crew to reach the nearest
waystation to give or receive information.</p>

<p>The advantage of these siding sets is coming more and more to be
realized. With the telegraph method of dispatching, a train is ordered
to pass another train at a certain siding, let us say. It reaches this
point, and to use a railroad expression, "goes into the hole." Now, if
anything happens to the second train whereby it is delayed, the first
train remains tied up at that siding without the possibility of either
reaching the dispatcher or being reached by him. With the telephone
station at the siding, which requires no operator, this is avoided. If a
train finds itself waiting too long, the conductor goes to the siding
telephone and talks to the dispatcher, possibly getting orders which
will advance him many miles that would otherwise have been lost.</p>

<p>It is no longer necessary for a waystation operator to call the
dispatcher. When one of these operators wishes to talk to the dispatcher,
he merely takes his telephone receiver off the hook, presses
a button, and speaks to the dispatcher.</p>

<p>With the telephone it is a simple matter to arrange for provision
so that the chief dispatcher, the superintendent, or any other
official may listen in at will upon a train circuit to observe the character
of the service. The fact that this can be done and that the
operators know it can be done has a very strong tendency to improve
the discipline.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[Page 337]</a></span></p><p>The dispatchers are so relieved, by the elimination of the strain
of continuous telegraphing, and can handle their work so much more
quickly with the telephone, that in many cases it has been found
possible to increase the length of their divisions from 30 to 50 per
cent.</p>

<p><b>Railroad Conditions.</b> One of the main reasons that delayed
the telephone for so many years in its entrance to the dispatching
field is that the conditions in this field are like nothing which has yet
been met with in commercial telephony. There was no system developed
for meeting them, although the elements were at hand. A
railroad is divided up into a number of divisions or dispatchers'
districts of varying lengths. These lengths are dependent on the
density of the traffic over the division. In some cases a dispatcher
will handle not more than 25 miles of line. In other cases this district
may be 300 miles long. Over the length of one of these divisions
the telephone circuit extends, and this circuit may have upon
it 5 or 50 stations, <i>all of which may be required to listen upon the line
at the same time</i>.</p>

<p>It will be seen from this that the telephone dispatching circuit
partakes somewhat of the nature of a long-distance commercial
circuit in its length, and it also resembles a rural line in that it has a
large number of telephones upon it. Regarding three other characteristics,
namely, that many of these stations may be required to
be in on the circuit simultaneously, that they must all be signaled
selectively, and that it must also be possible to talk and signal on
the circuit simultaneously, a telephone train-dispatching circuit
resembles nothing in the commercial field. These requirements
are the ones which have necessitated the development of special
equipment.</p>

<p><b>Transmitting Orders.</b> The method of giving orders is the same
as that followed with the telegraph, with one important exception.
When the dispatcher transmits a train order by telephone, he writes
out the order as he speaks it into his transmitter. In this way the
speed at which the order is given is regulated so that everyone receiving
it can easily get it all down, and a copy of the transmitted
order is retained by the dispatcher. All figures and proper names
are spelled out. Then after an order has been given, it is repeated
to the dispatcher by each man receiving it, and he underlines each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[Page 338]</a></span>word as it comes in. This is now done so rapidly that a man can
repeat an order more quickly than the dispatcher can underline.
The doubt as to the accuracy with which it is possible to transmit
information by telephone has been dispelled by this method of procedure,
and the safety of telephone dispatching has been fully established.</p>

<p><b>Apparatus.</b> The apparatus which is employed at waystations
may be divided into two groups&mdash;the selector equipment and the telephone
equipment. The selector is
an electro-mechanical device for
ringing a bell at a waystation when
the dispatcher operates a key
corresponding to that station. At
first, as in telegraphy, the selector
magnets were connected in series
in the line, but today all systems
bridge the selectors across the
telephone circuit in the same way
and for the same reasons that it
is done in bridging party-line
work. There are at the present time three types of selectors in
general use, and the mileage operated by means of these is probably
considerably over 95 per cent of the total mileage so operated in the
country.</p>

<br /><b>Fig. 476. Western Electric Selector</b><br />
<a href="images/fig476.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>The Western Electric Selector.</i> This selector is the latest and
perhaps the simplest. Fig. 475 shows it with its glass dust-proof
cover on, and Fig. 476 shows it with the cover removed. This selector
is adapted for operating at high speed, stations being called
at the rate of ten per second.</p>

<p>The operating mechanism, which is mounted on the front of
the selector so as to be readily accessible, works on the central-energy
principle&mdash;the battery for its operation, as well as for the operation
of the bell used in connection with it, both being located at the
dispatcher's office. The bell battery may, however, be placed at the
waystation if this is desired.</p>

<p>The selector consists of two electromagnets which are bridged
in series across the telephone circuit and are of very high impedance.
It is possible to place as many of these selectors as may be desired
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[Page 339]</a></span>across a circuit without seriously affecting the telephonic transmission.
Direct-current impulses sent out by the dispatcher operate
these magnets, one of which is slow and the other quick-acting.
The first impulse sent out is a long impulse and pulls up both armatures,
thereby causing the pawls above and below the small ratchet
wheel, shown in Fig. 476, to engage with this wheel. The remaining
impulses operate the quick-acting magnet and step the wheel
around the proper number of teeth, but do not affect the slow-acting
magnet which remains held up by them. The pawl connected to
the slow-acting magnet merely serves to prevent the ratchet wheel
from turning back. Attached to the ratchet wheel is a contact whose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_340" id="Page_340">[Page 340]</a></span>position can be varied in relation to the stationary contact on the
left of the selector with which this engages. This contact is set so
that when the wheel has been rotated the desired number of teeth,
the two contacts will make and the bell be rung. Any selector
may thus be adjusted for any station, and the selectors are thus interchangeable.
When the current is removed from the line at the
dispatcher's office, the armatures fall back and everything is restored
to normal. An "answer-back" signal is provided with this selector
dependent upon the operation of the bell. When the selector at a
station operates, the bell normally rings for a few seconds. The
dispatcher, however, can hold this ring for any length of time desired.</p>

<p>The keys employed at the dispatcher's office for operating
selectors are shown in Fig. 477. There is one key for each waystation
on the line and the dispatcher calls any station by merely
giving the corresponding key a quarter turn to the right. Fig. 478
shows the mechanism of one of these keys and the means employed
for sending out current impulses over the circuit. The key is adjustable
and may be arranged for any station desired by means of
the movable cams shown on the rear in Fig. 478, these cams, when
occupying different positions, serving to cover different numbers
of the teeth of the impulse wheel which operate the impulse contacts.</p>

use throughout the country today is known as the Gill, after its inventor.
It is manufactured for both local-battery and central-energy
types, the latter being the latest development of this selector.
With the local-battery type, the waystation bell rings until stopped
by the dispatcher. With the central-energy type it rings a definite
length of time and can be held for a
longer period as is the case with the
Western Electric selector. The selector
is operated by combinations of
direct-current impulses which are sent
out over the line by keys in the dispatcher's
office.</p>

<p>The dispatcher has a key cabinet,
and calls in the same way as
already described, but these keys instead
of sending a series of quick
impulses, send a succession of impulses
with intervals between corresponding
to the particular arrangement of teeth in the corresponding
waystation selector wheel. Each key, therefore, belongs definitely
with a certain selector and can be used in connection with
no other.</p>

<p>A concrete example may make this clearer. The dispatcher
may operate key No. 1421. This key starts a clockwork mechanism
which impresses at regular intervals, on the telephone line, direct-current
impulses, with intervals between as follows: 1-4-2-1. There
is on the line one selector corresponding to this combination and
it alone, of all the selectors on the circuit, will step its wheel clear
around so that contact is made and the bell is rung. In all
the others, the pawls will have slipped out at some point of the
revolution and the wheels will have returned to their normal positions.</p>

<p>The Gill selector is shown in Fig. 479. It contains a double-wound
relay which is bridged across the telephone circuit and operates
the selector. This relay has a resistance of 4,500 ohms and a high
impedance, and operates the selector mechanism which is a special
modification of the ratchet and pawl principle. The essential features
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[Page 342]</a></span>of this selector are the "step-up" selector wheel and a time
wheel, normally held at the bottom of an inclined track.</p>

<p>The operation of the selector magnet pushes the time wheel
up the track and allows it to roll down. If the magnet is operated
rapidly, the wheel does not get clear down before being pushed
back again. A small pin on the side of the pawl, engaging the selector
wheel normally, opposes the selector wheel teeth near their outer
points. When the time wheel rolls to the bottom of the track, however,
the pawl is allowed to drop to the bottom of the tooth. Some
of the teeth on the selector wheel are formed so that they will effectually
engage with the pawl only when the latter is in normal position,
while others will engage only while the pawl is at the bottom
position; thus innumerable combinations can be made which will
respond to certain combinations of rapid impulses with intervals
between. The correct combination of impulses and intervals steps
the selector wheel clear around so that a contact is made. The
selector wheels at all other stations fail to reach their contact position
because at some point or points in their revolution the pawls
have slipped out, allowing the selector wheels to return "home."</p>

<p>The "answer-back" is provided in this selector by means of
a few inductive turns of the bell circuit which are wound on the
selector relay. The operation of the bell through these turns induces
an alternating current in the selector winding which flows
out on the line and is heard as a distinctive buzzing noise by the
dispatcher.</p>

<p><i>The Cummings-Wray Selector.</i> Both of the selectors already
described are of a type known as the <i>individual-call</i> selectors, meaning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[Page 343]</a></span>that only one station at a time can be called. If a plurality of
calls is desired, the dispatcher calls one station after another. The
third type of selector in use today is of a type known as the <i>multiple-call</i>,
in which the dispatcher can call simultaneously as many stations
as he desires.</p>

<p>The Cummings-Wray selector and that of the Kellogg Switchboard
and Supply Company are of this type and operate on the
principle of synchronous
clocks. When the dispatcher
wishes to put through a
call, he throws the keys of
all the stations that he desires
and then operates a
starting key. The bells at
all these stations are rung
by one operation.</p>

<p>The dispatcher's sending
equipment of the Cummings-Wray
system is shown
in Fig. 480, and the waystation selector in Fig. 481. It is necessary
with this system for the clocks at all stations to be wound every
eight days.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>In the dispatcher's master sender the clock-work mechanism
operates a contact arm which shows on the face of the sender in
Fig. 480. There is one contact for every station on the line. The
clock at this office and the clocks at all the waystation offices start
together, and it is by this means that the stations are signaled,
as will be described later, when the detailed operation of the circuits
is taken up.</p>

<p><b>Telephone Equipment.</b> Of no less importance than the selective
devices is the telephone apparatus. That which is here illustrated
is the product of the Western Electric Company, to whom we are
indebted for all the illustrations in this chapter.</p>

<p><i>Dispatcher's Transmitter.</i> The dispatcher, in most cases, uses
the chest transmitter similar to that employed by switchboard operators
in every-day service. He is connected at all times to the telephone
circuit, and for this reason equipment easy for him to wear is
essential. In very noisy locations he is equipped with a double head
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[Page 344]</a></span>receiver. On account of the dispatcher being connected across
the line permanently and of his being required to talk a large part of the
time, there is a severe drain on the transmitter battery. For this
reason storage batteries are generally used.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p><i>Waystation Telephones.</i> At the waystations various types of
telephone equipment may be used. Perhaps the most common is
the familiar desk stand shown in Fig. 482, which, for railroad service,
is arranged with a special
hook-switch lever for use
with a head receiver.</p>

<p>Often some of the familiar
swinging-arm telephone
supports are used, in
connection with head receivers, but certain special
types developed particularly for railway use are advantageous,
because in many cases the operator who
handles train orders is located in a tower where he
must also attend to the interlocking signals, and for
such service it is necessary for him to be able to get
away from the telephone and back to it quickly. The
Western Electric telephone arm developed for this use
is shown in Fig. 483. In this the transmitter and the receiver are
so disposed as to conform approximately to the shape of the operator's
head. When the arm is thrown back out of the way it opens
the transmitter circuit by means of a commutator in its base.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[Page 345]</a></span></p><p><i>Siding Telephones.</i> Two types of sets are employed for siding
purposes. The first is an ordinary magneto wall instrument, which
embodies the special apparatus and circuit features employed in the
standard waystation sets. These are used only where it is possible to
locate them indoors or in booths along the line. These sets are permanently
connected to the train wire, and since the chances are
small that more than one of them will be in use at a time, they are
rung by the dispatcher, by means
of a regular hand generator, when
it is necessary for him to signal a
switching.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p>In certain cases it is not feasible
to locate these siding telephone
sets indoors, and to meet these conditions
an iron weather-proof set
is employed, as shown in Figs. 484
and 485. The apparatus in this set
is treated with a moisture-proofing
compound, and the casing itself is
impervious to weather conditions.</p>

<p><i>Portable Train Sets.</i> Portable
telephone sets are being carried
regularly on wrecking trains and their use is coming into more and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[Page 346]</a></span>more general acceptance on freight and passenger trains. Fig. 486
shows one of these sets equipped with a five-bar generator for calling
the dispatcher. Fig. 487 shows a small set without generator for
conductors' and inspectors' use on lines where the dispatcher is at all
times connected in the circuit.</p>

<p>These sets are connected to the telephone circuit at any point
on the line by means of a light portable pole arranged with terminals
at its outer extremity for hooking over the line wires, and with flexible
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[Page 347]</a></span>conducting cords leading to the portable set. The use of these sets
among officials on their private cars, among construction and bridge
gangs working on the line, and among telephone inspectors and repairmen
for reporting trouble, is becoming more and more general.</p>

<p><b>Western Electric Circuits.</b> As already stated, a telephone train-dispatching
circuit may be from 25 to 300 miles in length, and upon
this may be as many stations as can be handled by one dispatcher.
The largest known number of stations upon an existing circuit of
this character is 65.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig488_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 488. Dispatcher's Station&mdash;Western Electric System</b><br />
<a href="images/fig488.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><i>Dispatcher's Circuit Arrangement.</i> The circuits of the dispatcher's
station in the Western Electric system are shown in Fig.
488, the operation of which is briefly as follows: When the dispatcher
wishes to call any particular station, he gives the key corresponding
to that station a quarter turn. This sends out a series of rapid
direct-current impulses on the telephone line through the contact
of a special telegraph relay which is operated by the key in a local
circuit. The telegraph relay is equipped with spark-eliminating
condensers around its contacts and is of heavy construction throughout
in order to carry properly the sending current.</p>

<p><i>Voltage.</i> The voltage of the sending battery is dependent on
the length of the line and the number of stations upon it. It ranges
from 100 to 300 volts in most cases. When higher voltages are
required in order successfully to operate the circuit, it is generally
customary to install a telegraph repeater circuit at the center of the
line, in order to keep the voltage within safe limits. One reason for
limiting the voltage employed is that the condensers used in the
circuit will not stand much higher potentials without danger of burning
out. It is also possible to halve the voltage by placing the
dispatcher in the center of the line, from which position he may
signal in two directions instead of from one end.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[Page 348]</a></span></p><p><i>Simultaneous Talking and Signaling.</i> Retardation coils and
condensers will be noticed in series with the circuit through which
the signaling current must pass before going out on the line.
These are for the purpose of absorbing the noise which is caused
by high-voltage battery, thus enabling the dispatcher to talk and
signal simultaneously. The 250-ohm resistance connected across
the circuit through one back contact of the telegraph relay absorbs
the discharge of the 6-microfarad condenser.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 489. Selector Set&mdash;Western Electric System</b><br />
<a href="images/fig489.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><b>Waystation Circuit.</b> The complete selector set for the waystations
is shown in Fig. 489, and the wiring diagram of its apparatus
in Fig. 490. The first impulse sent out by the key in the dispatcher's
office is a long direct-current impulse, the first tooth being three
or four times as wide as the other teeth. This impulse operates
both magnets of the selector and attracts their armatures, which,
in turn, cause two pawls to engage with the ratchet wheel, while
the remaining quick impulses operate the "stepping-up" pawl and
rotate the wheel the requisite number of teeth. Retardation coils
are placed in series with the selector in order to choke back any
lightning discharges which might come in over the line. The selector
contact, when operated, closes a bell circuit, and it will be noted
that both the selector and the bell are operated from battery current
coming over the main line through variable resistances. There
are, of course, a number of selectors bridged across the circuit, and
the variable resistance at each station is so adjusted as to give each
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[Page 349]</a></span>approximately 10 milliamperes, which allows a large factor of safety
for line leakage in wet weather. The drop across the coils at 10
milliamperes is 38 volts. If these coils were not employed, it is clear
that the selectors nearer the dispatcher would get most of the current
and those further away very little.</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<br /><b>Fig. 490. Selector Set&mdash;Western Electric System</b><br />

<p>A time-signal contact is also indicated on the selector-circuit
diagram of Fig. 490. This is common to all offices and may be operated
by a special key in the dispatcher's office, thereby enabling him
to send out time signals over the telephone circuit.</p>

<br /><b>Fig. 491. Gill Dispatcher's Station</b><br />
<a href="images/fig491.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><b>Gill Circuits.</b> The circuit arrangement for the dispatcher's
outfit of the Gill system is shown in Fig. 491. This is similar to
that of the Western Electric system just described. The method
of operation also is similar, the mechanical means of accomplishing
the selection being the main point of difference. In Fig. 492 the
wiring of the Gill selector at a waystation for local-battery service
is shown. The selector contact closes the bell circuit in the station
and a few windings of this circuit are located on the selector magnets,
as shown. These provide the "answer-back" by inductive means.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig492_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 492. Gill Selector&mdash;Local Battery</b><br />
<a href="images/fig492.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_350" id="Page_350">[Page 350]</a></span></p><p>Fig. 493 shows the wiring of the waystation, central-energy Gill
selector. In this case, the local battery for the operation of the bell
is omitted and the bell is rung, as is the case of the Western Electric
selector, by the main sending battery in the dispatcher's office.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig493_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 493. Gill Selector&mdash;Central Energy</b><br />
<a href="images/fig493.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The sending keys of these two types of circuits differ, in that
with the local-battery selector the key contact is open after the
selector has operated, and the ringing of the bell must be stopped by
the dispatcher pressing a button or calling another station. Either
of these operations sends out a new current impulse which releases
the selector and opens its circuit.</p>

<p>With the central-energy selector, however, the contacts of the
sending key at the dispatcher's office remain closed after operation for
a definite length of time. This is obviously necessary in order that
battery may be kept on the line for the operation of the bell. In this
case the contacts remain closed during a certain portion of the revolution
of the key, and the bell stops ringing when that portion of the
revolution is completed. If, however, the dispatcher desires to give
any station a longer ring, he may do so by keeping the key contacts
closed through an auxiliary strap key as soon as he hears the "answer-back"
signal from the called station.</p>

<p><b>Cummings-Wray Circuits.</b> The Cummings-Wray system, as previously
stated, is of the multiple-call type, operating with synchronous
clocks. Instead of operating one key after another in order
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[Page 351]</a></span>to call a number of stations, all the keys are operated at once and
a starting key sets the mechanism in motion which calls all these
stations with one operation. Fig. 494 shows the circuit arrangement
of this system.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig494_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 494. Cummings-Wray System</b><br />
<a href="images/fig494.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>In order to ring one or more stations, the dispatcher presses the
corresponding key or keys and then operates the starting key. This
starting key maintains its contact for an appreciable length of time
to allow the clock mechanism to get under way and get clear of the
releasing magnet clutch. Closing the starting key operates the
clock-releasing magnet and also operates the two telegraph-line
relays. These send out an impulse of battery on the line operating
the bridged 2,500-ohm line relays and, in turn, the selector releasing
magnets; thus, all the waystation clocks start in unison with the
master clock. The second hand arbor of each clock carries an arm,
which at each waystation is set at a different angle with the normal
position than that at any other station. Each of these arms makes
contact precisely at the moment the master-clock arm is passing over
the contact corresponding to that station.</p>

<p>If, now, a given station key is pressed in the master sender, the
telegraph-line relays will again operate when the master-clock arm
reaches that point, sending out another impulse of battery over the
line. The selector contact at the waystation is closed at this moment;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[Page 352]</a></span>therefore, the closing of the relay contact operates the ringing relay
through a local circuit, as shown. The ringing relay is immediately
locked through its own contact, thus maintaining the bell circuit
closed until it is opened by the key and the ringing is stopped.</p>

<p>As the master-clock arm passes the last point on the contact
dial, the current flows through the restoring relay operating the restoring
magnet which releases all the keys. A push button is provided
by means of which the keys may be manually released, if desired.
This is used in case the dispatcher presses a key by mistake. Retardation
coils and variable resistances are provided at the waystation
just as with the other selector systems which have been described
and for the same reasons.</p>

<p>The circuits of the operator's
telephone equipment
shown in Fig. 495, are also
bridged across the line. This
apparatus is of high impedance
and of a special
design adapted to railroad
service. There may be any
number of telephones listening
in upon a railroad train
wire at the same time, and
often a dispatcher calls in
five or six at once to give
orders. These conditions have necessitated the special circuit arrangement
shown in Fig. 495.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig495_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 495. Telephone Circuits</b><br />
<a href="images/fig495.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>The receivers used at the waystations are of high impedance
and are normally connected, through the hook switch, directly across
the line in series with a condenser. When the operator, at a waystation
wishes to talk, however, he presses the key shown. This
puts the receiver across the line in series with the retardation coil
and in parallel with the secondary of the induction coil. It closes
the transmitter battery circuit at the same time through the primary
of the induction coil.</p>

<p>The retardation coil is for the purpose of preventing excessive
side tone, and it also increases the impedance of the receiver circuit,
which is a shunt on the induction coil. This latter coil, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[Page 353]</a></span>is of a special design which permits just enough current to flow
through the receiver to allow the dispatcher to interrupt a waystation
operator when he is talking.</p>

<p>The key used to close the transmitter battery is operated by
hand and is of a non-locking type. In some cases, where the operators
are very busy, a foot switch is used in place of this key. The use of
such a key or switch in practical operation has been found perfectly
satisfactory, and it takes the operators but a short time to become
used to it.</p>

<p>The circuits of the dispatcher's office are similarly arranged,
Fig. 495, being designed especially to facilitate their operation. In
other words, as the dispatcher is doing most of the work on the circuit,
his receiver is of a low-impedance type, which
gives him slightly better transmission than the waystations
obtain. The key in his transmitter circuit
is of the locking type, so that he does not have to
hold it in while talking. This is for the reason that
the dispatcher does most of the talking on this circuit.
Foot switches are also employed in some cases
by the dispatchers.</p>

<p><b>Test Boards.</b> It is becoming quite a general
practice among the railroads to install more than
one telephone circuit along their rights-of-way. In
many cases in addition to the train wire, a message
circuit is also equipped, and quite frequently a block
wire also operated by telephone, parallels these two.
It is desirable on these circuits to be able to make
simple tests and also to be able to patch one circuit
with another in cases of emergency.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig496_t.jpg" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 496. Test Board</b><br />
<a href="images/fig496.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Test boards have been designed for facilitating this work. These
consist of simple plug and jack boxes, the general appearance of
which is shown in Fig. 496. The circuit arrangement of one of these
is shown in Fig. 497. Each wire comes into an individual jack as
will be noted on one side of the board, and passes through the inside
contact of this jack, out through a similar jack on the opposite side.
The selector and telephone set at an office are taken off these inside
contacts through a key, as shown. The outside contacts of this key
are wired across two pairs of cords. Now, assume the train wire
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[Page 354]</a></span>comes in on jacks <i>1</i> and <i>3</i>, and the message wire on jacks <i>9</i> and <i>11</i>.
In case of an accident to the train wire between two stations, it is
desirable to patch this connection with a message wire in order to
keep the all-important train wire working. The dispatcher instructs
the operator at the last station which he can obtain, to insert plugs
<i>1</i> and <i>2</i> in jacks <i>1</i> and <i>10</i>, and plugs <i>3</i> and <i>4</i> in jacks <i>3</i> and <i>12</i>, at
the same time throwing the left-hand key. Then, obtaining an
operator beyond the break by any available means, he instructs
him likewise to insert plugs <i>1</i> and <i>2</i> in jacks <i>9</i> and <i>2</i>, and
plugs <i>3</i> and <i>4</i> in jacks <i>11</i> and <i>4</i>, similarly throwing the left-hand
key. By tracing this out, it will be observed that the train wire
is patched over the disabled section by means of the message circuit,
and that the selector and the telephone equipment are cut over
on to the patched connections; in other words, bridged across the
patching cords.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig497_t.png" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 497. Circuits of Test Board</b><br />
<a href="images/fig497.png">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>It will also be seen that with this board it is possible to open any
circuit merely by plugging into a jack. Two wires can be short-circuited
or a loop made by plugging two cords of corresponding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[Page 355]</a></span>colors into the two jacks. A ground jack is provided for grounding
any wire. In this way, a very flexible arrangement of circuits is
obtained, and it is possible to make any of the simple tests which
are all that are usually required on this type of circuit.</p>

<p><b>Blocking Sets.</b> As was just mentioned, quite frequently in
addition to train wires and message circuits, block wires are also
operated by telephone. In some cases separate telephone instruments
are used for the blocking service, but in others the same man
handles all three circuits over the same telephone. The block wire
is generally a converted telegraph wire between stations, usually
of iron and usually grounded. It seldom ranges in length over six
miles.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig498_t.jpg" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 498. Blocking Set</b><br />
<a href="images/fig498.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Where the block wires are operated as individual units with
their own instruments, it is unnecessary to have any auxiliary apparatus
to be used in connection with them. Where, however, they
are operated as part of a system and the same telephone is used on
these that is used on the train wire and message wire, additional
apparatus, called a blocking set, is required. This blocking set,
shown in Figs. 498 and 499, was developed especially for this service
by the Western Electric Company. As will be noted, a repeating
coil at the top and a key on the front of the set are wired in connection
with a pair of train wire cords. This repeating coil is for
use in connecting a grounded circuit to a metallic circuit, as, for
instance, connecting a block wire to the train wire, and is, of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[Page 356]</a></span>course, for the purpose of eliminating noise. Below the key are
three combined jacks and signals. One block wire comes into each
of these and a private line may be brought into the middle one.
When the next block rings up, a visual signal is displayed which
operates a bell in the office by means of a local circuit. The operator
answers by plugging the telephone cord extending from the
bottom of the set into the proper jack. This automatically restores
the signal and stops the bell.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/fig499_t.jpg" alt="" />
<br /><b>Fig. 499. Blocking Set</b><br />
<a href="images/fig499.jpg">View full size illustration.</a></div>

<p>Below these signals appear four jacks. One is wired across
the train wire; one across the message
wire; and the other two are bridged
across the two pairs of patching cords
on each side of the set. The operator
answers a call on any circuit by plugging
his telephone cord into the proper
jack.</p>

<p>If a waystation is not kept open in
the evening, or the operator leaves it
for any reason and locks up, he can
connect two blocks together by means
of the block-wire cords. These are
arranged simply for connecting two
grounded circuits together and serve to
join two adjacent blocks, thereby eliminating
one station. A jack is wired
across these cords, so that the waystation
operator can listen in on the connection if he so desires.</p>

<p>In some cases not only are the telephone circuits brought into the
test board, but also two telegraph wires are looped through this
board before going to the peg switchboard. This is becoming quite
a frequent practice and, in times of great emergency, enables
patches to be made to the telegraph wires as well as to the telephone
wires.</p>

<p><b>Dispatching on Electric Railways.</b> As interurban electric railways
are becoming more extended, and as their traffic is becoming
heavier, they approximate more closely to steam methods of operation.
It is not unusual for an electric railway to dispatch its cars exactly
as in the case of a steam road. There is a tendency, however, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[Page 357]</a></span>this class of work, toward slightly different methods, and these will
be briefly outlined.</p>

<p>On those electric railways where the traffic is not especially heavy,
an ordinary magneto telephone line is frequently employed with
standard magneto instruments. In some cases the telephone sets are
placed in waiting rooms or booths along the line of the road. In
other cases it is not feasible to locate the telephone indoors and then
iron weather-proof sets, such as are shown in Figs. 484 and 485,
are mounted directly on the poles along the line of railway. With
a line of this character there is usually some central point from
which orders are issued and the trainmen call this number when
arriving at sidings or wherever they may need to do so.</p>

<p>Another method of installing a telephone system upon electric
railways is as follows: Instead of instruments being mounted in
booths or on poles along the line, portable telephone sets are carried
on the cars and jacks are located at regular intervals along the right-of-way
on the poles. The crew of the car wishing to get in touch
with the central office or the dispatcher, plugs into one of these
jacks and uses the portable telephone set. At indoor stations, in
offices or buildings belonging to the railroad, the regular magneto
sets may be employed, as in the first case outlined.</p>

<p>On electric railway systems where the traffic is heavy, the train
or car movements may be handled by a dispatcher just as on the
steam railroad. There is usually one difference, however. On a
steam road, the operators who give the train crews their orders and
manipulate the semaphore signals are located at regular intervals
in the different waystations. No such operators are usually found
on electric railways, except, perhaps, at very important points, and,
therefore, it is necessary for the dispatcher to be able to signal cars
at any point and to get into communication with the crews of these
cars. He does this by means of semaphores operated by telephone
selectors over the telephone line. The telephone circuit may be
equipped with any number of selectors desired, and the dispatcher
can operate any particular one without operating any other one on
the circuit. Each selector, when operated, closes a pair of contacts.
This completes a local circuit which throws the semaphore arm to the
"danger" position, at the same time giving the dispatcher a distinctive
buzz in his ear, which informs him that the arm has actually
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[Page 358]</a></span>moved to this position. He can get this signal only by the operation
of the arm.</p>

<p>Each semaphore is located adjacent to a telephone booth in which
is also placed the restoring lever, by means of which the semaphore
is set in the "clear" position by the crew of the car which has been
signaled. The wall-type telephone set is usually employed for this
class of service, but if desired, desk stands or any of the various
transmitter arms may be used.</p>

<p>It is necessary for the crew of the car which first approaches a
semaphore set at "danger," to get out, communicate with the dispatcher,
and restore the signal to the "clear" position. The dispatcher
can not restore the signal. The signal is set only in order
that the train crew may get into telephonic communication with the
dispatcher, and in order to do this, it is necessary for them to go
into the booth in any case.</p>

<h2>Transcriber's Notes.</h2>

<p>Spelling variants where it wasn't possible to determine the author's
intent were left as is. These include:
"clockwork" and "clock-work;"
"doorkeeper" and "door-keeper;"
"interrelation" and "inter-relation;"
"multicyclic" and "multi-cyclic;"
"redesign" and "re-design," along with derivatives.</p>

<p>Added closing double quote in Steinmetz entry in list of authorities:
"Theoretical Elements of Electrical Engineering."</p>

<p>Changed "switch-hook" to "switch hook" on page 88: "the subscriber's
switch hook."</p>

<p>Page 107 says there is room for 300 banks of 100 multiple jacks, but
then says this allows for 3,000 multiple jacks in all, rather than
30,000. Based on the figure, 300 banks should be 30 banks, which would
correct the arithmetic. However, I did not change this.</p>

<p>Changed "bi-paths" to "by-paths" on page 185:
"circuits or by-paths."</p>

<p>Changed "appararus" to "apparatus" on page 209: "The sectional apparatus."</p>

<p>Changed "two number" to "two-number" on page 312: "the two-number calls
are ticketed."</p>

<p>On page 333, a paragraph begins with "It has been only within the past three few."
Perhaps the author meant "It has been only within the past three years" or
"It has been only within the past few years." But since I didn't know, I left is
as is.</p>

<p>Changed "them ain" to "the main" on page 333: "on the main line."</p>

<p>Changed "weatherproof" to "weather-proof" on page 357:
"iron weather-proof sets."</p>

<p>Changed "interoffice" to "inter-office" three times on page 364, to match the
spelling in the body of the document: "meant by inter-office trunking;" "inter-office connection
system;" "of the inter-office connection."</p>

<p>Changed "break-down" to "breakdown" on page 367:
"provision against breakdown."</p>

<p>Changed "way-station" to "waystation" twice on page 372: "with a waystation set;"
and "a waystation on a block wire."</p>

<p>Changed "way stations" to "waystations" on page 375, in the entry for Long-distance
switching.</p>

<p>Each page of the Index repeated this text: "Note.&mdash;For page numbers see foot of pages."
They were removed.</p>
